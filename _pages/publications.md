I am conducting research in various areas related to model-driven systems engineering for cyber-physical systems, including the model-driven development of semantically well-defined software architectures, digital shadows and digital twins, modeling methods, software languages, and more. The resulting publications are available as PDF and Bibtex from my [Google Scholar profile page](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=6ImtercAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao). 

- Preprints of publications in press are available from my [preprints](../preprints/) website.
- Selected presentations can be found on my [presentations](../presentations) website.
- [Collected bibtex sources](https://github.com/awortmann/awortmann.github.io/raw/master/_bibliography/andreaswortmann.bib) of my publications.
