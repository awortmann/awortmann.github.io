# Concepts and Terminology

## What makes a digital twin a digital twin?

This is one of the essential questions in the field of digital twins and there are various publications and conceptual models giving different answers (see the 112 definitions of digital twins [collected here](TODO)). Yet, the definition based on data flows [1] is the only one that distinguishes digital twins from other kinds of systems qualitatively by investigating the data flows between the digital twin and the twinned system. The gap of not explaining what a digital twin consists of is filled by the 5D model of digital twins [2].
