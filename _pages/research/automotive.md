Developing software for automotive systems has become increasingly complex. Sophisticated driver assistance, collaboration, and Car2X-communication systems as well as advanced active and passive safety-systems result in complex, software-intensive automotive systems. As these feature-driven subsystems may be arbitrarily combined by the customer, a huge amount of distinct variants needs to be managed, developed, and tested. Thus, we are carrying out numerous projects in automotive software engineering, here we concentrate on the modeling of functional and logical architectures for collaborative systems, on managing variability, and on model-driven testing. Recently, automotive also turned to [digital twins](../digital-twins/) and we are conducting research on this as well.
