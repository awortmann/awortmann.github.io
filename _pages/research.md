This website presents selected research topics and related publications. The full list of publications is available from my [publications](../publications) website. Presentations of keynotes and inivited talks are available from my [presentations](../presentations) website as well.

Here are your rewritten paragraphs, each condensed to 100 words or fewer while preserving the formatting and links:

### Automotive Software Engineering

Modern automotive systems demand complex software for driver assistance, Car2X communication, and safety features. Customers can combine these features in countless ways, creating vast variability that must be managed, developed, and tested. Our research focuses on modeling functional and logical architectures for collaborative systems, managing variability, and advancing model-driven testing to address these challenges effectively.

### Digital Twins

Digital twins are used across industries—automotive, avionics, medicine—to monitor and optimize cyber-physical systems. Despite varied definitions (often ambiguous, narrow, or utopian), we define them as software systems using models and data to represent, predict, and prescribe behavior for specific purposes. They are not tied to any technology or domain and don’t require completeness. This perspective raises key questions, some explored in my talk, [*Ceci n’est pas un jumeau numérique*](https://edt.community/events/event/ceci-nest-pas-un-jumeau-numerique/).

### Industry 4.0

Industry 4.0 revolutionizes manufacturing through four disruptions: data connectivity, advanced analytics, human-machine interaction, and digital-to-physical technologies like robotics and 3D printing. Digital twins—integrating data, models, and services—are key to optimizing production and sustainability. Our research focuses on modeling languages, manufacturing data management, and engineering self-adaptive digital twins for smarter, more efficient Industry 4.0 systems.

### Robotics

Robotics applications require expertise in software engineering and domain-specific knowledge. Teams of software, robotics, and domain experts must bridge the gap between conceptual challenges and technical solutions. To simplify development, we research model-driven approaches for service robotics and manufacturing, enabling efficient collaboration among diverse experts without requiring deep software expertise.

### Software Language Engineering

Designing effective languages for software and systems development is critical. Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) empower non-developers to configure systems using familiar concepts. However, DSLs must balance computer precision with human comprehension. Our research focuses on systematic engineering of modeling languages and reusable libraries, leveraging component-based software engineering and product lines to meet diverse domain needs.
