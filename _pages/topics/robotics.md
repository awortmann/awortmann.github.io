Deploying robotics applications requires expertise from multiple domains, including general software engineering and the application domain itself. Consequently, successful robotics applications are developed by teams of software experts, robotics experts, and application domain experts. The conceptual gap between application domain challenges and implementation domain solutions gives rise to accidental complexities from solving problem domain challenges with programming domain details. This complicates development and may lead to failure. Domain and robotics experts are rarely software engineering experts. Their involvement in the software engineering of reusable robotics applications requires that they become software experts or that implementation details can be abstracted. To enable the efficient engineering of robotics systems in heterogeneous teams with experts from manifold domains, we conduct research on the model-driven development of service robotics software  and robotic manufacturing.
