# Official rules

- Can be found in the examination regulations of your study program
- According to the examination regulations (PO)
- Only professors of the faculty (or staff members who have special authorization) are allowed to hand out a thesis topic, i.e. to be the examiner

# Topic search

## When to start?
- 3-6 months before the planned starting date

## How to search?

- Look for topics at the institute web pages
- Contact institutes or departments via e-mail
- Please do not send emails to all members of an institute or department!
- Ask several (not all!) departments in parallel for a topic
  - asking only your favorite department may delay your studies in case it does not work out
- Often on-demand topics possible

# Contact

## How should I formulate my e-mail request to (hopefully) be successful?

- Personal details
- Name
- Study program
- Number of semesters
- Current number of credit points
- Attach your CV and transcript of records
- Interests and qualifications
  - Which topics/courses do I / did I like?
  - What are you good at?
  - Which courses did you pass that may qualify you for a thesis at the respective institute?
- Planned starting date of your thesis
- Please note: The person who reads that e-mail possibly receives several requests per
week and very often he/she may not know you personally. Thus you have to tell him/her
everything that may be helpful for the decision process

## What if the contact person does not respond?

- Please wait for approximately 1 week (7 days)
- Then you can send a friendly reminder

## What if you receive a rejection?

- You can ask whether it is worth waiting for a certain period and them ask again
- Ask another institute

# Theses in industry

- The examiner who issues the topic has to be a professor (companies cannot give out topics)
- Contacting potential examiners early is mandatory to discuss/adjust the topic, to involve the external supervisor, to clarify legal issues
- Topic description
- Often the description of the topic is fairly generic (e.g. identify and improve best method), i.e., neither the student nor the examiner knows exactly what to do
- Sometimes thesis topics have lower scientific claims such that it is not sufficiently demanding for the degree you want to obtain
