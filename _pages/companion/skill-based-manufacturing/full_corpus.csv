1;Using Knowledge Representation and Task Planning for Robot-agnostic Skills on the Example of Contact-Rich Wiping Tasks;10.1109/CASE56687.2023.10260413;IEEE Xplore;"M. Mayr; F. Ahmad; A. Duerr; V. Krueger";Using Knowledge Representation and Task Planning for Robot-agnostic Skills on the Example of Contact-Rich Wiping Tasks;2023;2023 IEEE 19th International Conference 2023;The transition to agile manufacturing, Industry 4.0, and high-mix-low-volume tasks require robot programming solutions that are flexible. However, most deployed robot solutions are still statically programmed and use stiff position control, which limit their usefulness. In this paper, we show how a single robot skill that utilizes knowledge representation, task planning, and automatic selection of skill implementations based on the input parameters can be executed in different contexts. We demonstrate how the skill-based control platform enables this with contact-rich wiping tasks on different robot systems. To achieve that in this case study, our approach needs to address different kinematics, gripper types, vendors, and fundamentally different control interfaces. We conducted the experiments with a mobile platform that has a Universal Robots UR5e 6 degree-of-freedom robot arm with position control and a 7 degree-of-freedom KUKA iiwa with torque control.;"Kinematics; Knowledge representation; Manipulators; Planning; Position control; Service robots; Torque control";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Froschauer";Towards user-oriented programming of skill-based Automation Systems using a domain-specific Meta-Modeling Approach;2019;2019 IEEE 17th International Conference 2019;Upcoming trends in manufacturing focus on flexible configuration of products up to lot-size one. This mass customization raises a need of flexible manufacturing and production systems that should react on fast changing market demands. As a result, it is getting more and more important to model all needed assets or skills in an user-oriented and configurable manner. Assets can represent any type of data or skill information needed in a manufacturing domain. Data information could be for example shown to a human worker (e.g. work instructions, images, videos or animations) or could be required by robots (e.g. coordinates, velocities). Skill information represent any type of executable functionality provided by a device. This paper shows a generic approach to model needed context information of (collaborative) manufacturing tasks. This approach supports skill-based engineering enabling the usage of various components from different vendors. In addition, this work presents a domain-specific modeling approach of skills including the definition and validation of custom modeling rules.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Krueger";SkiROS2: A Skill-Based Robot Control Platform for ROS;2023;2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference 2023;The need for autonomous robot systems in both the service and the industrial domain is larger than ever. In the latter, the transition to small batches or even “batch size 1” in production created a need for robot control system architectures that can provide the required flexibility. Such architectures must not only have a sufficient knowledge integration framework. It must also support autonomous mission execution and allow for interchangeability and interoperability between different tasks and robot systems. We introduce SkiROS2, a skill-based robot control platform on top of ROS. SkiROS2 proposes a layered, hybrid control structure for automated task planning, and reactive execution, supported by a knowledge base for reasoning about the world state and entities. The scheduling formulation builds on the extended behavior tree model that merges task-level planning and execution. This allows for a high degree of modularity and a fast reaction to changes in the environment. The skill formulation based on pre-, hold-and post-conditions allows to organize robot programs and to compose diverse skills reaching from perception to low-level control and the incorporation of external tools. We relate SkiROS2 to the field and outline three example use cases that cover task planning, reasoning, multisensory input, integration in a manufacturing execution system and reinforcement learning.;"Cognition; Organizations; Production; Reinforcement learning; Robot control; Systems architecture; Tutorials";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Ruskowski";Skills Composition Framework for Reconfigurable Cyber-Physical Production Modules;2023;2023 IEEE 28th International Conference 2023;While the benefits of reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) are well-known, there are still challenges to their development, including, among others, a modular software architecture that enables rapid reconfiguration without much reprogramming effort. Skill-based engineering improves software modularity and increases the reconfiguration potential of RMS. Nevertheless, a skills' composition framework with a focus on frequent and rapid software changes is still missing. The behavior trees (BTs) framework is a novel approach that enables the intuitive design of modular hierarchical control structures. BTs have been mostly explored from the AI and robotics perspectives, and little work has been done in investigating their potential for composing skills in the manufacturing domain. This paper proposes a framework for skills' composition and execution in skill-based reconfigurable cyber-physical production modules (RCPPMs). It is based on distributed BTs and provides good integration between low-level devices' specific code and AI-based task-oriented frameworks. We have implemented the provided models for the IEC 61499-based distributed automation controllers. This shows the instantiation of the proposed framework with specific industrial technology to enable its evaluation by the automation community.;"Adaptation models; Artificial intelligence; behavior trees; Computational modeling; Computer architecture; Manufacturing Systems; Production; Protocols; reconfigurable cyber-physical production modules; reconfigurable production systems; Robots; skill-based engineering; skills' composition framework; Software; Software architecture";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Riedel";Skill-based Metamodel for sustaining the process-oriented cyber-physical System Description;2019;2019 IEEE 39th Central America 2019;Digitalization slowly but steadily transforms the modern production cells by adding an IT layer to their structure, which, subsequently, leads to the use of cyber-physical systems (CPS) as production cell components. Digital representation of those components through the definition of the corresponding description models starts in the early design phase of the engineering process. The model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach promotes increased reusability of component models and allows an automatic generation of the system of interest model and its validation through simulation, which results in a shorter design phase. However, existing solutions for CPS description models contain mainly skills and functionalities of the component from a task-oriented perspective to achieve platform-independent code generation for the components control. Semantic information in the skills description usually is completely absent or present only to the extent, which is not enough to match the corresponding components to the product requirements and necessary production processes. Instead, production cell components are manually assigned to the manufacturing processes, which are required for the product. This manual step hinders the automatic production cell model generation based on the product requirements. To allow automatic matching from product descriptions to specific CPSs, a new approach to CPS description is necessary. This description should allow the entirely automatic generation of production cell models through the matching of CPS skills and product requirements. In this paper, a semantic metamodel for CPS is presented. This metamodel enriches CPS models with high-granularity graph-based skill descriptions, which, in combination with the appropriate manufacturing process descriptions, allow automatic matching for production planning and further simulation and ontimization.;"CPS; MBSE; Metamodel";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Dorofeev;Skill-Based Engineering in Industrial Automation Domain: Skills Modeling and Orchestration;2020;2020 IEEE/ACM 42nd International Conference 2020;Software engineering in the industrial automation domain requires generic methods to keep the development complexity at an acceptable level. However, nowadays various PLC vendors use different dialects of the standardized programming languages in their tools, which hinders the re-usability and interoperability across the platforms. The service-oriented approaches can serve to overcome interoperability issues. In distributed control systems, the functionality of an automation component can be offered to the other parties that constitute a production system via a standardized interface, easing the orchestration of the whole system. This paper proposes such a generic interface that hides away the low-level implementation details of a particular functionality and provides a common semantic model for the execution. Further, we show how using such an interface can help to support and automate the overall engineering process, combining the functionality of different components to fulfill a production task. The reference implementation of the proposed concept was used in an industrial demonstrator, which shows the benefits in the system flexibility due to components interoperability and re-usability compared to the traditional control approaches.;"Automation; Conferences; Grippers; IEC Standards; industrial automation; Interoperability; OPC UA; orchestration; Production; skill-based engineering; Skills; Software engineering";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While there are different concepts in research on how to simplify the engineering process by using generic skills or capabilities of devices, run-time control is still achieved with proprietary communication protocols and commands. The concept in this paper uses skills not only in the phase of engineering but also consequently for direct and generic control of field-devices. An executable skill-metamodel therefore describes the methodological functionality which is implemented by using OPC UA due to its vendor independence as well as built-in services and information model. The implementation uses client/server-based OPC UA and the pub/sub pattern to prepare for a deterministic real-time control in conjunction with TSN, which is required by industrial automation.;"Automation; capabilities; Control; Engineering; Field-Device; IEC Standards; Interoperability; OPC UA; Production; Semantics; Skills";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Leconte";Skill-Based Easy Programming Interface for Industrial Applications;2022;2022 IEEE/SICE International Symposium 2022;This paper presents a framework that uses robot skills as a building blocks to ease robot programming. The presented framework is geared towards industrial usage and attempts to lower the technological barrier for workers to not just operate the robots on their factory floor but also to program them. By lowering the technological complexity of programming robots in a vendor-independent fashion, it becomes possible for companies with a need to reprogram robots frequently to automate their operations.The presented framework is built on top of a ROS2 middleware and uses 3-layered architecture to provide reusable skills that are easy to parameterize leveraging the capabilities of modern collaborative robots as well as on traditional industrial robots. The proposed framework further provides a Human-Machine Interface and a database so that the composed skills can be orchestrated and parameterized for a given application in a user-friendly way.The proposed framework’s efficacy in a production environment is demonstrated by three experiments followed by the results with a strong case for the industrial utilization of the approach by quantifying its temporal and economical benefits. Lastly, the paper ends with a discussion on the results and conclusions on the use of this framework and the advantages it can bring to the industry.;"Companies; Production facilities; Programming; Robotic assembly; Service robots; System integration; User interfaces";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Wollert";Performance Evaluation of Skill-Based Order Assignment in Production Environments With Multiagent Systems;2022;2022 IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Industrial Electronics;The fourth industrial revolution introduces disruptive technologies to production environments. One of these technologies is multiagent systems (MASs), where agents virtualize machines. However, the agent’s actual performances in production environments can hardly be estimated as most research has been focusing on isolated projects and specific scenarios. We address this gap by implementing a highly connected and configurable reference model with quantifiable key performance indicators for production scheduling and routing in single-piece workflows. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to optimize the search of extrema in highly connected distributed systems. The benefits, limits, and drawbacks of MASs and their performances are evaluated extensively by event-based simulations against the introduced model, which acts as a benchmark. Even though the performance of the proposed MAS is, on average, slightly lower than the reference system, the increased flexibility allows it to find new solutions and deliver improved factory planning outcomes. Our MAS shows an emerging behavior by using flexible production techniques to correct errors and compensate for bottlenecks. This increased flexibility offers substantial improvement potential.

12;Optimizing schedules for adaptable manufacturing systems;10.1109/ETFA.2015.7301452;IEEE Xplore;"N. Keddis; B. Javed; G. Igna; A. Zoitl";Optimizing schedules for adaptable manufacturing systems;2023;2023 IEEE 28th International Conference 2023;Adaptability and changeability are becoming the key features of future manufacturing. With adaptability comes a need to dynamically and frequently change factory topologies throughout the life-cycle of manufacturing systems. These changes are necessary to respond to changes in markets that result in new products, production volumes, and product variants. In addition to flexibly switching between different setups, the resulting schedules still have to be optimal to a certain extent to stay profitable. In this paper, we extend a capability-based planning approach to generate timed automata models that are used to solve the scheduling problem. The capability-based approach automatically generates an action sequence that defines all necessary production resources and operations for a product. The action sequence is then automatically transformed into models in UPPAAL - a model-checker for timed automata - and used to generate a schedule for production orders. The result can then be executed on the different production resources. An example scenario based on an industrial production system used for educational purposes shows the suitability of this approach.;"Automata; Job shop scheduling; Manufacturing Systems; Optimal scheduling; Production facilities; Schedules";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Many existing machine tools, handling and logistics systems are already generic and not bound to a specific product a-priori. Yet this flexibility and reconfigurability on the asset level is lost in automated systems that are limited to executing a small set of predefined actions in a fixed sequence. The SkillPro1 project aims to develop a holistic service-oriented framework for modelling and orchestration of modern adaptable manufacturing systems. The core concept is a unified abstraction for manufacturing tasks: skills provided by the available assets and the requirements of the different production steps. The skill-based system model enables the transition from generic high-level descriptions to low-level formats that can be directly executed.

Lee";Kinesthetic Skill Refinement for Error Recovery in Skill-Based Robotic Systems;2024;2024 21st International Conference 2024;Skill-based robotic systems can perform tasks more flexibly than typical industrial manipulators. These systems are equipped with a repertoire of reusable skills and take advantage of a knowledge base about their workspace. That being so, the robot can execute tasks composed of a combination of different skills, tools, and objects without having to be reprogrammed explicitly for each task. Despite its advantages, these systems are affected by modeling errors and an inaccurate knowledge base. Such issues lead to failures in production. Since automated error detection is still an open problem, they often have to be solved by a robot operator. That is generally done by accessing the implementation of the faulty task and determining what to change to achieve the desired outcome, which is time-consuming and requires expertise. The proposed work aims to provide the robot operator with a faster and more intuitive error recovery method for a skill-based system via GUI-assisted kinesthetic refinement of robot skills. Furthermore, partially automated error recovery strategies are included. First, the targeted skills can be composed of an arbitrary number of steps with corresponding reversion behaviors. Second, consecutive human corrections on different parts of a given object are analyzed to infer a possible object pose error. Experiments show that our method takes one-fourth of the time required for conventional manual correction.;"Knowledge based systems; Manipulators; Manuals; Production; Robots; Service robots; Task analysis";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the impedance control framework, it is a very important and difficult problem of how to decide impedance parameters to realize the prescribed desired task. Since there are large similarities between impedance control and human fingertips control, one promising technique to overcome this problem is extracting the impedance parameters from human demonstration, and implementing them on the robot controller. However, if there exist disturbances and/or noise at the playback stage, which are not taken into account at the skill acquisition stage, the executed task by robot is far different from the human demonstration. In order to realize the robust skill, the authors introduce the hybrid architecture. This architecture enables robots to use the most suitable dynamics (impedance parameters) for each task situation. Moreover, because of event driven architecture, one can expect the improvement of robustness of the skill in the time domain.;"Hidden Markov models; Humans; Impedance; manufacturing processes; Noise robustness; Process control; Robot control; Robot kinematics";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Evidence From Chinese Manufacturing Firms;2022;2022 IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management;Organizational capabilities, such as technological capabilities and marketing capabilities are key determinants of the success of technology commercialization (TC). However, literature has rarely explored how firms combine and balance these two potentially interrelated yet competing capabilities in pursuing successful TC. Adopting insights from the ambidexterity perspective, this article examines the tensions and interplay between technological capabilities and marketing capabilities, and conceptualizes the simultaneous pursuit of both capabilities as capability ambidexterity. We propose that, having a balancing capability (properly matching technological capabilities and marketing capabilities to avoid conflicts), a combining capability (effectively utilizing both capabilities), and simultaneously applying the balancing capability and the combining capability positively affect TC success. We also identify human resource-based conditions (high-commitment work systems) as a contingency under which the balancing capability and the combining capability are more likely to promote TC success. We report results from a sample of 262 Chinese manufacturing firms (based on a total of 524 respondents) that provide general support for the proposed model.

In this paper, we investigate the advantages of using skills - universal control device interfaces - for generating complex logic in distributed control environments. By enriching a skill interface with the information about the dynamic behavior of a component under control, we compose the functionalities of individual control devices. The logic, required for such composition, is automatically derived from the interface description and the production plan, identifying the required skill sequence. The evaluation, executed using two industrial demonstrators, shows that the approach successfully handles different behavioral models and is capable of generating fault-tolerant orchestrators, including error handling scenarios.

To find an optimum or near-to-optimum solution without any size-limitation of the problem, a multi-objective Tabu Search (TS) algorithm is proposed. The validity of the model and performance analyses of CBVCMSs over basic layouts is tested through benchmarking a numerical example. At the end, the efficacy of distributed layout for generating CBVCMS is illustrated because of its flexibility, minimizing the objective function of the developed mathematical model, less traveled distance by components of family groups, and acceptable capacity utilization. Moreover, the results illustrate the priority of CBVCMS in comparison to the original classical Cellular Manufacturing Systems (CMSs) from the capacity utilization point of view.;"Capability Based Virtual Cellular Manufacturing System (CBVCMS); Capacity Utilization; Cellular manufacturing; Distributed layout; Functional layout; Heuristic algorithms; industrial engineering; Layout; Linear programming; Manufacturing Systems; Mathematical model; Meta-heuristics; Resource Element; Tabu Search (TS)";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Kleinert";Flexible Control Configuration in Modular Plants via Control Function Library;2023;2023 IEEE 28th International Conference 2023;This paper presents the design, implementation, and validation of a Control Function Library to support standardized design and deployment of control functions for automated industrial process operation. The Control Function Library establishes a standardized set of control functions for chemical production. Five categories (Time-based, Continuous, Reversible, Stopping, and Ramping control functions) are developed and encapsulated in the first version of the library. The Control Function Library enables scalability by providing a flexible framework for adding or modifying control functions to accommodate specific production requirements. This scalability allows control systems to adapt to changing requirements or environments without significant redevelopment efforts, especially for capability-based operation configuration and execution. Furthermore, the reuse of Control Function Libraries across various projects or applications minimizes development time and resource costs by avoiding the need to re-engineer processes from scratch for each new modular plant.;"Chemicals; Component-oriented Architecture; Control Configuration; Control Function for Chemical Production Process; Control systems; Costs; Flexible Process Automation; Libraries; Manufacturing automation; Modular Plant; Process control; Production; Scalability";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Wenger";Evaluating Skill-Based Control Architecture for Flexible Automation Systems;2023;2023 IEEE 28th International Conference 2023;For the manufacturing of customized products, systems require easier and better adaptivity of the production plant especially in terms of the control software. In recent research projects, a skill-based architecture has been introduced and presented within an industrial demonstrator proposing the required adaptivity. Within this work, the skill-based architecture is compared to a more traditional component-based hierarchical approach to identify strength and weakness of this approach, which then enables further improvements of the skill-based architecture. The flexibility of control software can not directly be measured. Therefore execution time, modularity, readability, and reusability considering the impact of component exchanges are used as evaluation criteria. Modularity and reusability are measured by the number of needed Function Blocks (FBs) and that can also be used for other systems respectively. To evaluate readability three derived metrics from the basic Halstead Metric are used. The comparison shows that the skill-based architecture is more complex but much more flexible than the more traditional component-based hierarchical approach.;"Automation; Belts; Computer architecture; Robot kinematics; Software";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Additionally, market trends such as small batch size induced by individual customer requirements lead to modular production systems elevating flexibility as well as complexity of smart factories. That leads to more difficulties using conventional diagnosis methods. The ever changing constellations of production modules requires to include context information of the manufacturing domain to enable a suitable fault diagnosis.This paper shows the identification and classification of relevant context information for fault diagnosis in skill-based production systems. The concept of faults is embedded into the Capability-Skill-Service Model used to describe the aforementioned context. Suitable entities and their relations in the production system are outlined and the Knowledge Graph technology is used to make the the context information accessible.

24;Empowering End Users for Social Internet of Things;;IEEE Xplore;"J. E. Kim; X. Fan; D. Mosse";Empowering End Users for Social Internet of Things;2017;2017 IEEE/ACM Second International Conference 2017;We present Socialite, a novel end user programming tool for the Social Internet of Things (SIoT). SIoT is a new paradigm where IoT merges with social networks, allowing people and connected devices as well as the devices themselves to interact within a social network framework. Through an online survey with 60 potential users, we identified eight desired features for the SIoT, which were then clustered into four rule categories that can be programmed by end users and/or imposed by systems. The rules created by end users are used to reason about both devices and people in their social relationships to support automated decisions during runtime. Socialite uses ontology/semantic models for basic/low-level knowledge representation (e.g., device and user) to encapsulate the heterogeneity in devices from various manufacturers, and uses production rules (trigger-action programming) for high-level reasoning. With the ontology model, our reasoning supports both device type automation (e.g., current temperature from a thermostat) and capability-based automation (e.g., current temperature from any devices with the same capability). Furthermore, the Socialite rules leverage social relationships and device capabilities to facilitate collaboration by efficiently sharing configuration and information among users/friends and even with devices from people unknown to a user. In a 24-participant user study (12 with no programming experience), we found that Socialite was easy to learn and use, for both programmers and non-programmers. Participants were able to create automation based rules, social relationship involved rules, as well rules they created during the study.;"Automation; Cognition; Collaboration; End User Programming; Internet; Programming; Semantic Reasoning Framework; Social Internet of Things; Social network services; Thermostats";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Such events within the company, e.g., resource breakdowns, require the possibility of internal replanning of the production schedule. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can provide this required flexibility. To enable standardized interaction for agents, a vendor-independent description of products and production equipment, as well as their capabilities and skills, must be developed. The Asset Administration Shell (AAS) provides the standardized meta-model to achieve this goal. In this paper, a product AAS and the submodel for the required production plan are designed. Moreover, the associated MAS and interaction for the execution and replanning of the production sequence are presented. The system is validated using an assembly use-case in the real-world demonstrator environment of the SmartFactoryKL. Combining the concepts of MAS with the standardized structures of the AAS, skills and capabilities tackles the problem of MAS to be deployed in different companies. This approach enables widespread use and scalability of MAS leveraging their advantages in terms of flexibility and efficient reconfiguration.;"Asset Administration Shell; Electric breakdown; Fault tolerance; Fault tolerant systems; Multi-Agent System; Production equipment; Production systems; Scalability; Schedules; Skill-Based Dynamic Replanning";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The requirements of customised mass production imply that control and integration software needs to be adaptable after deployment in a shop floor (factory), possibly even without interrupting production. Today, software frameworks provide support to model and execute manufacturing processes. They, however, provide little support for reuse. In this paper, we present a framework based on capabilities, which supports manufacturing process templates. These templates are bound/allocated to a specific shopfloor setup, a specific set of machines, and executed using a distributed set of process engines. This enables the reuse of manufacturing processes, as well as transmitting and executing changed processes. The framework is implemented using the Eclipse Milo implementation of OPC UA in Java.

In this study, a human–robotic collaborative control system is developed for accurate path tracking subject to unknown external disturbances and multiple physical constraints. This is achieved by designing a model predictive control with a sliding-mode disturbance rejection term. To rule out the possibility of the constraints violation caused by external disturbances, tightened constraints are formulated to generate the control input signal. The proposed controller drives the robotic system remotely with enhanced smoothness and real-time human modification on the outputted performance so that the human experience can be fully transferred to robotic systems.

Ikeda";A generic Approach for the Industrial Application of Skill-based Engineering using OPC UA;2023;2023 IEEE 28th International Conference 2023;Current trends in the context of Industry 4.0 attempt to minimize production costs and increase productivity. Nowadays control systems consist of components from various manufacturers. Therefore, it must be possible to easily connect these components without any platform specific interface definitions or software implementations. A first approach is the industry standard OPC UA, which enables the definition of hardware-independent interfaces of automation components (i.e. PLCs). Many manufacturers already start to integrate this standard into their products but unfortunately it only defines the transport layer of data and not which data is to be transported. Therefore, vendor-overlapping communication is only possible in case there is common understanding of how variables and functions are named and interpreted. A promising step towards this is to define skills as atomic unit for modeling and operating automation processes. Consequently the fixed mapping of skills and manufacturing stations is no more necessary during the engineering process. When applying skill-based engineering concepts it is only important to model and orchestrate skills that can accomplish the required tasks. The mapping between required and available skills can be done on the fly. Accordingly in this paper we propose an OPC UA-based multi-layered approach to orchestrate and execute manufacturing workflows using production task-based skills operated on flexibly linked and different hardware components (i.e. manufacturing stations).;"Costs; Fourth Industrial Revolution; Hardware; Industries; Market research; Productivity; Software";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Even if the information models are designed following standardized guidelines, the aggregation of these individual information models often needs to be done manually, which requires a lot of effort and is error prone. To achieve an automated information aggregation, this paper presents a novel concept for modular production plants.

This paper focused on the energy consumption of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems operating under various modes across different seasons. We constructed multi-attribute and high-dimensional clustering vectors that encompass indoor and outdoor environmental parameters, along with historical energy consumption data. To enhance the K-means algorithm, we employed statistical feature extraction and dimensional normalization (SFEDN) to facilitate data clustering and deconstruction. This method, combined with the gated recurrent unit (GRU) prediction model employing adaptive training based on the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, was evaluated for robustness and stability through k-fold cross-validation. Within the clustering-based modeling framework, optimal submodels were configured based on the statistical features of historical 24-hour data to achieve dynamic prediction using multiple models. The dynamic prediction models with SFEDN cluster showed a 11.9% reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) compared to static prediction, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.890 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) reduction of 19.9%. When compared to dynamic prediction based on single-attribute of HVAC systems energy consumption clustering modeling, RMSE decreased by 12.6%, R2 increased by 4.0%, and MAPE decreased by 26.3%.

(International Journal of Aeronautical and Space Sciences);With the advent of the first generation of relaxed static stability (RSS) aircraft, such as the YF-16, the deep stall associated with the extremely demanding stability and control problems in the high angle-of-attack (AoA) flight envelope has become a significant issue. These problems can be entirely avoided by designing an aircraft with sufficient nose-down control capability. However, this approach leads to more complex aircraft design challenges, as they are related to the aircraft’s supersonic performance and its ability to maneuver at low speeds. This paper reviews the aircraft design issues and lessons learned for recovery from deep stalls in fighter aircraft designed with RSS configuration concepts by surveying published materials. The results of this review will benefit a wide audience, from students studying aircraft design at universities to engineers working for aerospace companies, by enhancing their understanding of deep stall characteristics in aircraft. Additionally, the design considerations for deep stall prevention and recovery, based on industrial development experience and lessons learned, are expected to reduce the amount of trial and error that occurs during the aircraft development process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This particular methodology renders the constituents of a decentralized machine learning paradigm private and allocates them to a diverse array of remote client apparatuses. Following this, a primary controller clusters the extracted machine learning data. This process effectively transforms a centrally controlled machine learning procedure into a distributed one, leading to significant potential benefits. Regrettably, the implementation of a progressive strategy for networked machine learning poses additional obstacles to the preservation of user data confidentiality and cyber-security apprehensions. The present endeavor aims to scrutinize the plausible hazards that decentralized machine learning may engender for the security and confidentiality of user data, as well as their well-being, through the lens of data transmission thresholds. These risks are contingent upon the salient stages of a machine learning model. The aforementioned procedures include: (i) establishing thresholds for raw data prior to processing; (ii) establishing thresholds for the learning framework; (iii) establishing thresholds for the obtained information; and (iv) establishing thresholds for the provisional outcome. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art hacking methodologies, evaluating their potential vulnerabilities at every stage of the transaction, and subsequently deliberated on practical solutions to address these issues. Ultimately, the survey culminates in an exposition of the obstacles and prospects that confront researchers in this intricate realm.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study focuses on the effectiveness of agile practices, specifically the pair programming and the test-first programming practices. Despite the importance of these functions, there exists a dearth of empirical evidence on the impact of agile practices on their development, raising questions about their potential to enhance correctness without affecting time-to-market. This paper aims to bridge this gap by comparing the application of agile practices with traditional approaches in the context of auxiliary function development. We conducted six experiments involving 122 participants (85 novices and 37 professionals) who used both traditional and agile methods to develop six auxiliary functions across three different domains. Our analysis of 244 implementations suggests the potential benefits of agile practices in auxiliary function development. Pair programming showed a tendency towards improved correctness, while test-first programming did not significantly extend the total development time, particularly among professionals. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously as they do not conclusively establish that agile practices outperform traditional approaches universally. As indicated by our results, the potential benefits of agile practices may vary depending on factors such as the programmer’s experience level and the nature of the functions being developed. Further research is needed to fully understand the contexts in which these practices can be most effectively applied and to address the potential limitations of our study.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is one of the key technologies to endorse the virtual and remote intelligent control system for home-devices (HD) in human comfort (disabled/elderly). The relevant research is in the initial stage, and how to realize the DT of home-equipment control has become a vital problem to be solved. This study expounds on the suggestion and application of the DT model and summarizes the research and application progress from the aspect of the home-devices’ DT (HDDT) modeling. This modelling approach is three-staged: in terms of physical entities, virtual entities, and connectivity (data communication). The proposed model utilizes an interactive mechanism for the intelligent control of HD, by integrating DT and virtual simulation technologies to establish a human cyber-physical system (HCPS), specifically addressing the challenges associated with remote-control problems. The HCPS aims to achieve a deep integration and interface between the physical and virtual spaces of smart-device information. Using the game theory approach to create multi-physical entities and DT entities of IoT-based HD like washing machines, lamps, breakers, heaters, kitchen equipment, TV, AC, etc. The next step is to develop high-performance smart devices and build a reasonable sensing network to improve the depth and range of connection.

However, effectively identifying defect features using post-processing algorithms remains challenging. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a microwave defect characterization algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). A defect dataset derived from reflection microwave signals, was manually compiled by detecting samples with critical defects. The CNN framework was utilized for precise classification of microwave signals, employing a classification encoding strategy to extract two-dimensional defect information and achieve automatic localization and imaging of defects. Multiple deep learning models were compared in both simulations and experiments, revealing that the proposed CNN exhibited significant advantages in feature extraction, enabling highly effective identification of internal defects even with a limited dataset. Compared with traditional algorithms, the detection accuracy of the proposed 1D-SENet has been improved by 53.35% and 50.66%, respectively, and can achieve detection of defects with a minimum size of Φ6mm. These validate the effectiveness of algorithm in intelligent and automated microwave characterization of delamination defects within composite materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Internet of Things is a cutting-edge technology solution that is used to link physical items with the digital world via a range of networks as well as communication technologies. The Internet of Things benefits from the smart settings in which mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) operate, making it more appealing to users and financially viable. Wireless sensors with MANETs may be integrated using the Internet of Things to develop new MANET-IoT devices and IT-based networks. Such a strategy lowers network deployment costs while increasing user mobility. That does, however, also bring up fresh, challenging issues about networking concerns. We introduced a new DAG-Blockchain architecture for MANET-IoT security in this study. The Multi-Factor PUF identification technique protects the network. Network topology is separated into clusters with all allowed nodes. We introduced the Secure Trust-based Dijikstra’s Method with numerous criteria for secure data transfer. We presented a Bi-Directional GRU for deep packet analysis. Deep packet inspection is used to identify intrusions, which are then blocked by a blocking mechanism. The suggested method achieved increased efficiency in the packet delivery ratio, productivity, time analysis, detection accuracy, and security level using the combination of algorithms. The numerical findings from the simulation and analysis of the proposed DAG-IDS in the WSN-IoT network reveal significant improvements across various performance metrics. Specifically, the DAG-IDS demonstrates enhanced network lifetime, achieving up to 220 cycles compared to 100 cycles in the BLOCKCHAIN method.

The substantial advancement of soft grippers may be attributed to the growth of soft robotics, the investigation of various materials, and the creation of flexible electronics. The field of soft robotics does have the potential to have a substantial influence, among other applications, on the field of soft grippers and manipulators. Grippers of various varieties are necessary for handling various types of items, both hard and soft. It is crucial to adopt flexible and adaptive gripping tactics to get more item holding flexibility. Soft-robotic grasping systems that are extremely flexible in terms of workpiece shape, size, and structure are an ideal choice for increasing production flexibility. The major reason for the review is to learn about the existing soft gripper and the repeatability of existing soft-robotic grippers with large payload capacities.

Considering the accuracy disparity between the mobile base and manipulator, this paper proposes a joint space coordination scheme for mobile manipulators to improve the execution quality of the end-effector trajectory obtained by learning from demonstrations in the task space. Additionally, a task-oriented manipulability is developed to further enhance the execution accuracy.

Effective coordination is crucial for cooperative task accomplishments. Multi-manipulator task distribution is highly complex because of the varying dynamic capabilities of the manipulators. We have introduced a novel fastest technique to quantify the dynamic task capability of the cooperative manipulator by scalar quantity and allocate the task accordingly. The scalar quantity determines the capability of applying an external wrench by end effector (EE) in line with the required wrench at the center of mass of the manipulating object. This quantity helps to diminish tracking errors in object manipulations or transportation and actuator saturation avoidance. The task distribution among the members is in proportion to their computed dynamic capability to ensure equal priority to the individual manipulators. The proposed task distribution formulation ensures the minimum magnitude of wrench interaction at the grasp point and the minimum internal wrench build-up in the object. Several physical simulation results assure trajectory tracking performance with the proposed task capability metric. The same metric aids in identifying the least capable manipulator, rearranging members for better performance, and deciding the required number of manipulators in the manipulator group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

One of the reasons that caused it, is our daily energy waste. People consume electricity in order to use home/work appliances and devices and also reach certain levels of comfort while working or being at home. However, even though the environmental impact of this behavior is not immediately observed, it leads to increased CO2 emissions coming from energy generation from power plants. It has been shown that about 40% of these emissions come from the electricity consumption and also that about 20% of this percentage could have been saved if we started using energy more efficiently. Confronting such a problem efficiently will affect both the environment and our society. Monitoring energy consumption in real-time, changing energy wastage behavior of occupants and using automations with incorporated energy savings scenarios, are ways to decrease global energy footprint. In this review, we study intelligent systems for energy management in residential, commercial and educational buildings, classifying them in two major categories depending on whether they provide direct or indirect control.

First, HRC systems should be adaptable and re-configurable to support fast production changes. However, in the development of HRC applications safety considerations are of paramount importance, as much as classical activities such as task programming and deployment. Hence, the reconfiguration and reprogramming of executing tasks might be necessary also to fulfill the desired safety requirements. Model-based software engineering is a suitable means for agile task programming and reconfiguration. We propose a model-based design-to-deployment toolchain that simplifies the routine of updating or modifying tasks. This toolchain relies on (i) UML profiles for quick model design, (ii) formal verification for exhaustive search for unsafe situations (caused by intended or unintended human behavior) within the model, and (iii) trans-coding tools for automating the development process.

L.; Kieliba, Ilona; Azenha, Miguel; Tonnesen, Thorsten; Lourenço, Paulo B.";A theta projection model for compressive creep behaviour of refractories at high temperature: application to alumina-spinel;2023;Meccanica (Meccanica);"Thermomechanical loads are normally applied to refractory materials throughout their service life whichever is their practical use (e.g. steel ladle, rotary kiln furnaces). Among all the phenomena that the refractories are exposed to, the influence of creep behaviour is essential in determining their performance. Creep of refractories is usually represented by simple creep laws such as Norton-Bailey, which lack the capacity for generalization. The theta projection creep method, on the other hand, was proposed in the twentieth century to predict the creep of metals and alloys across different temperatures and stresses. The model is represented by one exponential equation capable of representing the complete creep curve, and coefficients that are temperature and stress-dependent, thus enabling the representation of complex nonlinear creep behaviour. Since refractories have similar creep responses to metals, the theta projection creep model is validated to characterize the compressive creep behaviour of alumina-spinel refractories at temperatures between 1200 and 1500&nbsp;°C. Creep data from steady-state and transient temperature creep tests are used to calibrate the model. A regression by the least square method is applied to calculate the model’s parameters. The model shows good flexibility in fitting the test data of the alumina-spinel refractory over the three creep stages. A temperature and stress dependence model is derived for the theta coefficients, reducing the number of material parameters necessary to describe the material's behaviour. The experimental creep curves are presented, as well as the curves resulting from the identified parameters. The implications of the chosen creep data set on the definition of the model and its adequacy for this novel application are discussed.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This research gauged the efficacy of combining a generative co-design framework making use of agile and iterative co-design principles in an applied research and development project. The project produced an immersive virtual reality based digital solution in collaboration with the Australian Defence Force Special Operations Command (SOCOMD) Army. Specifically, the ParaVerse project sought to develop a solution considering the advanced Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) relevant to special operations soldiers for advanced parachute training. A Defence advisory group consisting of a series of subject matter experts was formulated to consult with the research and development team over the course of the co-design process. End-user testing with 35 SOCOMD personnel demonstrated the value of the ParaVerse application for SOCOMD personnel, speaking to the success of the leveraged generative co-design model. End-users rated ParaVerse as having greater capacity to influence education and training practices for SOCOMD and Defence generally in comparison to a pre-existing virtual parachute simulator. ParaVerse was also rated higher for satisfaction and useability and was associated with fewer instances of motion sickness. The Generative Co-Design Framework leveraged for this research provides one roadmap on how to integrate end-users in innovation design, particularly for projects working across the nexus of Defence and academia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Semi-autonomous systems with a medium degree of automation enable human-centered, flexible, and sustainable production, for instance, in hybrid decision-making. Especially in applications that do not meet the requirements for full automation and when humans are to be involved in their role as qualified decision-makers, teaming-capable systems are desirable and offer considerable advantages. This paper outlines the transdisciplinary concept of human–machine teaming and the role of human cognition in engineering tasks with multi-criteria decision-making. An illustrative real-life example from thermal spray technology is used to show how explainable artificial intelligence models offer targeted, hybrid cyber decision support. This new approach based on fuzzy pattern classifiers combines expert knowledge- and data-based modeling and enables a transparent interpretation of the results by the human user, as shown here using the example of test data from atmospheric plasma spraying. The method outlined can potentially be used to provide hybrid decision support for a variety of manufacturing processes and form the basis for advanced automation or teaming of humans and cyber-physical-production systems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The framework includes general implementations of agents and other software components for self-learning and adaptation, sensor data analysis, system modelling and simulation, as well as human-computer interaction. During an adaptation process, operators make changes to the production system, in order to increase capacity or manufacture a product variant. These changes are automatically captured and evaluated by the framework, building an experience base of adjustments that is then used to infer adaptation knowledge. The architecture of the framework consists of agents divided in two layers: the agents in the lower layer are associated with individual production modules, whereas the agents in the higher layer are associated with the entire production line. Modelling, learning, and adaptations can be performed at both levels, using a semantic model to specify the structure and capabilities of the production system. An evaluation of a prototype implementation has been conducted on an industrial assembly system. The results indicate that the use of the framework in a typical adaptation process provides a significant reduction in time and resources required.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The goal of the architecture is to reduce the implementation effort for the usage of artificial intelligence algorithms. The core of the CAAI is a cognitive module that processes the user’s declarative goals, selects suitable models and algorithms, and creates a configuration for the execution of a processing pipeline on a big data platform. Constant observation and evaluation against performance criteria assess the performance of pipelines for many and different use cases. Based on these evaluations, the pipelines are automatically adapted if necessary. The modular design with well-defined interfaces enables the reusability and extensibility of pipeline components. A big data platform implements this modular design supported by technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Kafka for virtualization and orchestration of the individual components and their communication. The implementation of the architecture is evaluated using a real-world use case.

(Journal of Data, Information and Management);The occurrence of a major medical event usually leads to a surge in the generation of medical waste. If the waste generated is not disposed of in a timely manner, it can pose a great threat to humans and the surrounding environment. Based on the large volume and hazardous nature of medical waste, this research explores the social value and importance of establishing a professional network for medical waste reverse logistics. A three-tier recycling network model consisting of recycling centres, testing and processing centres, reprocessing centres, power plants and landfill plants has been developed based on the special characteristics of medical waste. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was developed with the goal of minimizing costs. Genetic algorithm, MILP solver and Lingo solver are used to solve the problem of node selection and waste recycling volume allocation in the network. Several datasets were utilized to verify the effectiveness, demonstrating better solutions for problems of varying sizes. The results of the case study show that genetic algorithm can show good results in solving problems of different sizes. The solver's ability to solve the problem decreases as it grows in size. By comparing the methods used, choosing an efficient and accurate approach to the reverse logistics recovery problem has become more achievable. The results of the case study show the stability of the reverse logistics optimization model at different scales. The construction of the reverse logistics network optimization model resulted in lower total recycling costs and higher recycling efficiency. Finally, some insights are given based on the obtained results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Apart from all the tremendous benefits of IoT, this paradigm still suffers from challenges of security and privacy vulnerabilities and demands a secure system for effective utilization of services in real-world IoT scenarios relying on which the IoT consumers expect secure and trustworthy communications. Trust Management (TM), which is a crucial aspect of security, plays a vital role in ensuring the exchange of information in a secure manner and maintaining the reliability of a system by measuring the degree of trust on IoT devices, reducing the uncertainties and risks involved in the systems. Thus, in recent years, Blockchain technology has been utilized for developing security innovations in TM field for different classes of IoT applications. It can provide tamper-proof data by enabling more reliable trust information and integrity verification, ultimately enhancing its availability and privacy when storing and sharing information.

The weightage calculated for each aspect may be used to describe the critical leanness factors/indicators lean implementation and prioritizing the better one during decision making. The analysis identifies that Operational aspects are at top priority with “Overall Equipment Efficiency” as main indicator, followed by Financial aspects with “Expenditure on Employees” as major criteria and Human Resources focusing on “Management Commitment”.

Eng. Res. Devel. (Production Engineering);The importance of process monitoring has increased significantly in today’s manufacturing landscape due to several factors. These factors include stricter quality standards, the presence of complex and diverse processes for customized products, and a focus on sustainability in energy and material consumption. In order to seamlessly integrate process monitoring into the production planning process, it is essential to automate the monitoring process planning while also taking into account production planning. Given the increasing importance of high-quality processes and products, assembly processes have become critical, as errors in assembly can lead to expensive production costs. However, generating and validating different process monitoring alternatives in assembly planning can be challenging because different processes and resources exist for different assembly plans. This research aims to solve this problem by providing a method to validate process monitoring alternatives more efficiently, thereby reducing the amount of manual effort and expert knowledge. This goal is achieved through automated validation using two simulation approaches: Collision Testing and Ray Casting.

Yet, treating high water content CMS effectively is complex due to numerous influencing factors such as binder dosage, water content, curing time, etc. Machine learning has demonstrated significant promise in predicting unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and heavy metal leaching by including various characteristics of CMS stabilized with lime-activated slag. This study assesses the effectiveness of tree-based models such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), decision tree (DT), and light gradient boosting (LightGBM) in predicting the leachability of heavy metal and UCS of treated CMS samples. The dataset consists of 337 samples, of which 80% are designated for training and 20% are designated for testing. Monte Carlo simulations and tenfold cross-validation techniques are applied to improve the model’s performance. The analysis showed that the XGBoost model has superior reliability and accuracy compared to the DT and LightGBM models, with LightGBM showing the lowest predictive performance. The models are ranked as LightGBM &lt; DT &lt; XGBoost based on evaluation metrics such as Adjusted R-squared (Adj. R2), mean absolute error, and root mean squared error. Analysis of feature significance indicates that curing time, GGBS + CaO content, and water content significantly influence UCS. The correlational matrix demonstrates the effect of different input parameters on zinc metal leachability. The leachability of zinc is positively associated with water content but negatively associated with cement content and curing time.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Lately, the NeRFACE, a face reenactment method based on neural radiance fields, has been proposed, making the reconstruction accuracy of the training dataset much higher than the previous methods. However, face reenactment in realistic scenes often encounters poses and expressions that have not been seen before, which requires further improvement of the model’s generalization capability. Based on the idea of ensemble learning, we present EnNeRFACE as using the adaptive ensemble neural radiance fields architecture, which is mainly composed of a set of subgenerators and a controller. We divide the short video of human portraits into non-intersecting sub-datasets based on time correlation, thus enabling the trained subgenerators to have differentiated modeling capabilities. In response to different expression vectors, the generator dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to each generator so that the capabilities of the subgenerators are adequately exploited. Extensive experiments show that EnNeRFACE has more stable and superior performance in generalization (i.e., identity preservation, manipulation of expression and pose) than the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed adaptive ensemble structure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Indeed, uncertainties embedded in the machine unavailability (or random machine breakdowns), product demands, and process flow data were not considered by the previous studies to achieve a robust CBDL design. However, many real-life facility layout design applications may involve different types of uncertainties simultaneously, like fuzziness and stochasticity. Based on this motivation, for the first time in the literature, this paper introduces a novel robust capability-based distributed layout (R-CBDL) design problem under a mixed fuzzy-stochastic environment. First, a new fuzzy-stochastic optimization model of the R-CBDL design problem is developed by considering the random machine breakdowns and fuzzy demand/process flow data. Then, a hybrid solution approach based on a chance-constrained stochastic programming technique with a well-known interactive fuzzy resolution method is proposed. Thus, the random machine breakdowns and fuzzy part flow rates among different machining capabilities could be easily handled via the proposed approach. Fortunately, the proposed approach can also generate various risky and risk-free robust layout design alternatives under different probabilistic scenarios and uncertainty levels (α-cuts) according to the facility designer’s risk attitude. To show the validity and applicability of the proposed R-CBDL problem and hybrid solution approach, an extensive computational study with comparative analysis is first presented based on an illustrative numerical example under different machine capability overlap cases and probability distributions. Then, the performance of the proposed approach is also tested on a real-life cellular manufacturing system of a company. The computational experiments have shown that the proposed approach can accomplish more efficient robust layout design alternatives with on average 24.5% better total expected layout score when compared to the existing cellular layout of the manufacturing company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Based on the feature information inputted from the monocular camera, the signal acquisition and processing fusion of the astronaut gesture and eye-movement modal interaction can be performed. Compared with the single mode, the human-robot interaction model of bimodal collaboration can achieve the issuance of complex interactive commands more efficiently. The optimization of the target detection model is executed by inserting attention into YOLOv4 and filtering image motion blur. The central coordinates of pupils are identified by the neural network to realize the human-robot interaction in the eye movement mode. The fusion between the astronaut gesture signal and eye movement signal is performed at the end of the collaborative model to achieve complex command interactions based on a lightweight model. The dataset used in the network training is enhanced and extended to simulate the realistic lunar space interaction environment. The human-robot interaction effects of complex commands in the single mode are compared with those of complex commands in the bimodal collaboration. The experimental results show that the concatenated interaction model of the astronaut gesture and eye movement signals can excavate the bimodal interaction signal better, discriminate the complex interaction commands more quickly, and has stronger signal anti-interference capability based on its stronger feature information mining ability. Compared with the command interaction realized by using the single gesture modal signal and the single eye movement modal signal, the interaction model of bimodal collaboration is shorter about 79% to 91% of the time under the single mode interaction.

This review article aims to explore the development and manufacturing of SSAs and their potential to reduce material waste and energy consumption promoting sustainability. The article examines various categories of soft actuators, such as multi-responsive ones, shape-locking variants, and biological water-responsive models, as well as their implementation through&nbsp;multi-material printing and,&nbsp;3D and 4D printing techniques. The article also highlights the potential applications of these SSAs, including manufacturing, human–machine interaction, locomotion, and manipulation. Furthermore, the review explores various methods for reducing energy consumption and material waste in soft actuators, such as using recycled materials and eco-friendly manufacturing processes&nbsp;for a circular economy. Finally, the study provides a comprehensive analysis of SSAs and their potential to steer the evolution of robotics towards a more sustainable future and a&nbsp;circular economy.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

J. Control Autom. Syst. (International Journal of Control, Automation and Systems);"In robotics, reinforcement learning (RL) is often used to help robots learn complex tasks through interactions with their environment. A crucial aspect of RL is the design of reward functions; these functions guide the learning process by providing feedback on a robot’s actions. However, crafting these reward functions manually is time-consuming and requires extensive human expertise. In this paper, we propose a tree of action-reward generation (TARG) model that automates reward generation for a given task without the need for human fine-tuning. By using a large language model (LLM), we create a systematic action plan sequence to generate a tree of action that guides RL training. Proposed method facilitates the automatic generation of a reward tree, which stabilizes the training process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TARG framework, we conducted experiments involving a cabinet opening task within the IsaacSim simulation environment. The results demonstrated the potential of the proposed framework to significantly improve the adaptability and performance of robots in complex settings.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The recent breakthrough of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has motivated the preliminary explorations and adoptions of these models in the smart manufacturing field. However, despite the considerable amount of effort, existing research mainly focused on individual components without a comprehensive perspective to address the full potential of VLMs, especially for HRC in smart manufacturing scenarios. To fill the gap, this work offers a systematic review of the latest advancements and applications of VLMs in HRC for smart manufacturing, which covers the fundamental architectures and pretraining methodologies of LLMs and VLMs, their applications in robotic task planning, navigation, and manipulation, and role in enhancing human–robot skill transfer through multimodal data integration.

82;Precise control of page cache for containers;10.1007/s11704-022-2455-0;"Springer; Higher Education Press";"Wang, Kun; Wu, Song; Li, Shengbang; Huang, Zhuo; Fan, Hao; Yu, Chen; Jin, Hai";Precise control of page cache for containers;2024;Front. Comput. Sci. (Frontiers of Computer Science);Container-based virtualization is becoming increasingly popular in cloud computing due to its efficiency and flexibility. Resource isolation is a fundamental property of containers. Existing works have indicated weak resource isolation could cause significant performance degradation for containerized applications and enhanced resource isolation. However, current studies have almost not discussed the isolation problems of page cache which is a key resource for containers. Containers leverage memory cgroup to control page cache usage. Unfortunately, existing policy introduces two major problems in a container-based environment. First, containers can utilize more memory than limited by their cgroup, effectively breaking memory isolation. Second, the OS kernel has to evict page cache to make space for newly-arrived memory requests, slowing down containerized applications. This paper performs an empirical study of these problems and demonstrates the performance impacts on containerized applications. Then we propose pCache (precise control of page cache) to address the problems by dividing page cache into private and shared and controlling both kinds of page cache separately and precisely. To do so, pCache leverages two new technologies: fair account (f-account) and evict on demand (EoD). F-account splits the shared page cache charging based on per-container share to prevent containers from using memory for free, enhancing memory isolation. And EoD reduces unnecessary page cache evictions to avoid the performance impacts. The evaluation results demonstrate that our system can effectively enhance memory isolation for containers and achieve substantial performance improvement over the original page cache management policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;A self-centering and stiffness-controlled MEMS accelerometer;10.1038/s41378-023-00647-4;Nature Publishing Group;"Jin, Yiming; Ma, Zhipeng; Ye, Ziyi; Li, Mingkang; Zheng, Xudong; Jin, Zhonghe";A self-centering and stiffness-controlled MEMS accelerometer;2024;Microsyst Nanoeng (Microsystems & Nanoengineering);This paper presents a high-performance MEMS accelerometer with a DC/AC electrostatic stiffness tuning capability based on double-sided parallel plates (DSPPs). DC and AC electrostatic tuning enable the adjustment of the effective stiffness and the calibration of the geometric offset of the proof mass, respectively. A dynamical model of the proposed accelerometer was developed considering both DC/AC electrostatic tuning and the temperature effect. Based on the dynamical model, a self-centering closed loop is proposed for pulling the reference position of the force-to-rebalance (FTR) to the geometric center of DSPP. The self-centering accelerometer operates at the optimal reference position by eliminating the temperature drift of the readout circuit and nulling the net electrostatic tuning forces. The stiffness closed-loop is also incorporated to prevent the pull-in instability of the tuned low-stiffness accelerometer under a dramatic temperature variation. Real-time adjustments of the reference position and the DC tuning voltage are utilized to compensate for the residue temperature drift of the proposed accelerometer. As a result, a novel controlling approach composed of a self-centering closed loop, stiffness-closed loop, and temperature drift compensation is achieved for the accelerometer, realizing a temperature drift coefficient (TDC) of approximately 7 μg/°C and an Allan bias instability of less than 1 μg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Due to their manual nature, they are error-prone, leading to long lead times and costly rework. Thus, efficient co-customization of products and their production systems must be enabled by common data models and continuously linked software tools. Complex mechatronic products such as aircraft cabins are more and more likely to be developed via a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach using Systems Modeling Language (SysML). In assembly system design, model-based development often relies on AutomationML, a modeling and data exchange format for plant engineering information. To combine these concepts, an approach for assembly system configuration based on a SysML-representation of the product and an AutomationML-represantation of the plant is proposed. After the customer configures a unique product version, the corresponding SysML model will be analyzed by the outlined configuration algorithm to determine necessary changes to the assembly system. Based upon an AutomationML library with digital representations of the available assembly system components and their behavior, these logical and parametric changes will be implemented in the instantiated assembly system model. Using AutomationML, configuration can not only take place on the top-level logical model, but also on specific robot or PLC programs. These can be then used for simulations generating information about assemblability and assembly times, allowing improved design decisions once fed back to the product engineers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

New approaches to adapting manufacturing systems are therefore to be designed, particularly with the desire to detect more simply and more quickly the potential to take charge unforeseen needs, especially in a Collaborative Network Organizations (CNOs) environment. This raises the research question of How to assess the adaptability potential ofa manufacturing system in a context of(CNO)? In this regard, this paper proposes a functional framework of a decision making process that helps to identify the adaptability of manufacturing systems for a new product requirement within a collaborative network.

In manufacturing, the adoption of new materials and manufacturing processes is a common concern, for example, the use of new composite materials offer significant advantages in terms of energy efficiency and performance. However, their use poses challenges in terms of manufacturing and assembly. On the side of technological advances, the exploration of digitalisation, automation and robotics to improve efficiency is a strong trend. However, implementing these technologies requires investment and significant changes to existing assembly processes. To meet these challenges, fostering collaboration between design and manufacturing, as well as between manufacturer and its suppliers is often seen as the key solution for various industries. In this work, we present how capability modelling can help both parties to describe their demands and offers with respect to needed and provided quality properties such as set-up times or ecological footprint. These serve as input for a digital business ecosystem in which the pareto-optimal factory design can be chosen supported by a digital platform integrating the manufacturer and its suppliers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Also, this technological leap has provided new possibilities for the maintenance of production equipment to become data driven and in many cases predictive. This fourth industrial revolution is changing the role of humans at the shop floor. Visions of the dark factory arises, meaning fully automated factories where humans are redundant, both for physical processing and for decision making. The research on Smart maintenance shows great advances in predictive diagnostics and prognostic techniques. However, in manufacturing industry, studies have shown that up to 50–60% of equipment breakdowns are due to human errors. Some of these errors are partly addressed through the development of improved information aid, such as e.g., instructions through Augmented Reality and training in Virtual Reality. Still, the root cause of human errors in manufacturing industry haven’t been properly categorized in terms of e.g., neglect, lack of competence, unclear processes, or poor leadership. In this paper the potential of data driven maintenance is discussed from a human centric perspective. Considering the large part of failures being due to human factors and the possibilities of improvement through implementation of smart technologies, this paper argues for exploring the root causes of human errors in discrete item manufacturing systems and address the proper human centric technologies as a means of reducing these failures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This leads to increased complexity of dynamic manufacturing contexts due to more constellations of cyber-physical production modules, skills, and products. However, even existing approaches aiming to enhance efficient and resilient production, fault detection applications, usually requiring big amounts of data or knowledge, remains mainly unnoticed. Against this background, it is the objective of this paper to develop a model that extends skill-based production by means of incorporating automated fault detection. This includes the identification of required fault detection components as well as its integration into the process control for executing skills. Hence, to achieve this objective, state-of-the-art approaches of fault detection are adapted and integrated into the skill model. Finally, the elaborated model is prototypically implemented in a realistic demonstration environment to come up with a proof of concept. Since it is difficult to directly model faulty behavior of Cyber-Physical Production Modules in flexible production their nominal behavior during the execution of skills is modelled and compared with its actual behavior. Based on deviations and defined thresholds symptoms are generated.

On the way to implementing flexible and adaptable production systems, information support plays a decisive role. Only the use of intelligent and structured information processing across previous system boundaries and areas enables the coordination of requirements and capacities in dynamic production environments. The rigid communication structures in information systems of current production systems therefore need to be replaced by dynamic interaction, both horizontally between entities and vertically between different hierarchical levels. Multi-agent systems (MAS) are one way to meet the requirements for centralized and decentralized decision making in complex (cyber physical production) systems (CPPS). To prepare the instantiation of a MAS, it is necessary to structure and describe the information flows of a production system.

This paper proposes the integration of AAS (Asset Administration Shells), SBM (Skill-based manufacturing) and OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture), to enable more flexible manufacturing systems. The integration of these concepts provides a solution for achieving faster and easier dynamic reconfiguration in manufacturing systems, which is essential for fulfilling the demand of customization and flexibility in modern production systems. An Asset Administration Shell provides a standardized structure for describing assets and their administration, while Skill-based manufacturing enables the deployment of task-oriented machines that can self-configure, self-diagnose, and self-optimize their performance. The use of OPC UA as a communication protocol ensures that these systems can communicate with one another in a secure and reliable way. This paper presents a conceptual framework for the integration of these three open technologies.

Despite their clean and renewable energy source, photovoltaic systems encounter challenges arising from solar radiation, temperature variations, and environmental conditions, leading to fluctuations in current and voltage output and impacting power generation. The research addresses this concern by advocating for control strategies that optimize power extraction from the photovoltaic field. The central focus lies on the maximum power point (MPP), which denotes the optimal power transfer point on the current-voltage characteristic curve of a solar panel. Achieving precise MPP tracking is pivotal for bolstering system efficiency, given the task’s complexity in adapting to changing conditions. Existing tracking algorithms exhibit shortcomings in tracking rates and steady-state oscillations. To overcome these limitations, the study explores the application of ANNs in designing control algorithms. ANNs stand out for their agility in responding dynamically and adapting to nonlinear conditions. Yet, acquiring accurate training data for the controller remains a primary challenge. The investigation considers crucial factors like solar radiation, temperature, and optimal voltage as inputs for the controller. The proposed approach, built upon daily satellite-derived data for Latacunga city, yields promising results.

Within these complex and changing production environments, there is a demand for transparency on the energy consumption and related energy costs for production processes, so that these can be considered during planning and monitoring of machine skills. However, the ability to manufacture products by using such flexible production processes leads to various constellations in which it is difficult to identify and map the related energy consumption of production skills. The objective of this paper is to develop a concept that, in the context of a multi-agent distributed production control system, allows energy agents to interact with resource agents to access energy metering data for energy load profiling during the skill execution in production. A special focus is put on how the functions of energy agents can support a methodical creation of energy load profiles on the granular level of skills. The realization and results are presented on a realworld demonstrator of the SmartFactory-KL as part of a skill-based production environment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TheBehavior Tree-based TaskExecution (BTE) is seamlessly integrated into the acting/reacting layer, collaborating synergistically with the perception layer, which includes robot proprioception and object localization modules. This integration facilitates the efficient detection and handling of deviations, particularly those arising from failures during robotic manipulation (grasping), ensuring real-time responsiveness to environmental changes in collaborative assembly tasks.

Under this spectrum, Smart MicroGrid systems have emerged as retrofitting sets of Industry 4.0 technologies combining renewable energy and continuous energy monitoring towards improving energy efficiency, reduce operational costs, and enhance resiliency to external energetic crises. However, their integration has been challenged by the employees’ lack of required technological skills and technology acceptance. This work presents a three-phase training framework for Smart MicroGrid integration aiming at increasing the skills and competencies of personnel on managing smart micro-grid systems in manufacturing. The first phase involves preliminary learning activities in the form of online learning paths and hands-on training offered as Teaching and testbed assisted Learning Factory sessions. The second phase addresses the enhanced, daily duties that employees are requested to follow in a Smart MicroGrid policy depending on their organizational position. The third phase refers to the overall evaluation of the learning and technological penetration of the framework. The proposed framework has been validated by a training pilot for Smart MicroGrid adoption by a lifts’ manufacturer, presenting high learning penetration, an improved readiness level for technology integration and a more positive attitude towards everyday duty changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In some past studies of student learning, practice produces better learning than studying examples, whereas other studies show the opposite result. We reconcile and explain this apparent contradiction by suggesting that retrieval practice and example study involve different learning cognitive processes, memorization and induction, respectively, and that each process is optimal for learning different types of knowledge. We implement and test this theoretical explanation by extending an AI model of human cognition — the Apprentice Learner Architecture (AL) — to include both memory and induction processes and comparing the behavior of the simulated learners with and without a forgetting mechanism to the behavior of human participants in a laboratory study. We show that, compared to simulated learners without forgetting, the behavior of simulated learners with forgetting matches that of human participants better. Simulated learners with forgetting learn best using retrieval practice in situations that emphasize memorization (such as learning facts or simple associations), whereas studying examples improves learning in situations where there are multiple pieces of information available and induction and generalization are necessary (such as when learning skills or procedures).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Since faults occur rarely compared to nominal behavior of Cyber-Physical Production Modules (CPPM), it is difficult in common manufacturing environments and even harder in skill-based production to gain experience and knowledge about faults and the context they occur in. Hence, leveraging knowledge and data from multiple CPPM proves beneficial, facilitating the storage of acquired information regarding faults and their context in federated knowledge bases. However, although different approaches tackle the communication between distributed knowledge bases, the use for distributed knowledge-based fault detection and diagnosis in skill-based production environments remains mainly unseen. In this paper the focus lies on the development of a communication scheme that enables automated communication between fault detection and fault diagnosis components for a decentralised control setup to make distributed knowledge about faults accessible. This includes the definition of fault detection and fault diagnosis components and their offered services which encapsulate different forms of knowledge representations. For the communication between the components, a unified model is elaborated, and the required information is identified. An integration in a holonic manufacturing system of SmartFactoryKL is presented and an outlook for further research is given.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To increase the resilience and self-healing capabilities, greater automation of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is a key factor. It is a challenge to gather knowledge about faults, as these rarely occur compared to normal behavior. The flexibility in skill-based production systems makes this situation even more difficult. To overcome this challenge, data and knowledge about faults and their context from several Cyber-Physical Production Modules is used, which leads to federated knowledge databases. The knowledge databases are modeled in the Capability-Skill-Service-Fault-Symptom model (CSSFS model). To achieve the goal of high availability, resilience and autonomy of CPPS, automated decision-making for FDD using CSSFS applications is required. Therefore, automatic communication between FDD components is necessary. Therefore, focus of this paper is on the development of a communication scheme, which models participants using Asset Administration Shells and the I4.0 Language to model their interactions to enable automated communication and makes distributed knowledge accessible. To ensure decentralized control of these services, functionalities from several factory levels are encapsulated by Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) that follow a holonic structure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Improving the emergency capacity of urban power grids in extreme condition can assist the quick recovery of the system, and guarantee continuous consumption of the critical consumer to enhance the anti-vulnerability of power grid. In this paper, the functional resonance analysis model (FRAM) and system dynamics (SD) were integrated to construct a novel anti-vulnerability improvement method for large urban power system, which considered the impact of emergency input factors on anti-vulnerability and the relationship between them. Firstly, identify the vulnerability factor of urban power grids in extreme events by functional resonance analysis model, and determine the critical factor based on the Monte Carlo simulation. Then put the critical factor into the system dynamic model as vulnerability subsystem, emergency capacity as anti-vulnerability subsystems. Finally, by changing the anti-vulnerability input ratio and total inputs, determine the optimal anti-vulnerability investment strategy, realize the anti-vulnerability income maximize. The simulation results show that the optimal investment ratio is 45% for material resource costs, 30% for human resource costs, 20% for opportunity loss costs, and 5% for financial resources. And in this case, anti-vulnerability benefits would be improved by 4%. If the total input is raised to 3.4 times, the power grid benefit will be increased by 62%. However, there is also a limiting effect between total inputs and benefits. As total inputs increase by 5 × 10^5, the rate of improvement in benefit decreases from 7.9 to 4.29%, resulting in a decline of 3.61%. The proposed anti-vulnerability model can balance the economic benefit and demand of extreme viability, provide the technical support of effective anti-vulnerability strategy for power grid enterprise.;"Power grid; Vulnerability assessment; Anti-vulnerability investment; FRAM; System dynamics";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To address the shortcomings of original GJO algorithm, such as poor exploitation ability and ease of getting stuck in a local optimal region, a multi-strategy improved GJO algorithm (MSGJO) is proposed. Firstly, the random selection strategy of the nonlinear composite adaptive convergence factor is designed to realize the reasonable balance between the exploration ability and the exploitation ability of GJO algorithm. Furthermore, an enhanced sparrow explorer location update strategy is proposed to further search the optimal individual of current iteration, which improves the efficiency of GJO algorithm moving in target direction. Then, the genetic algorithm’s variation strategy is added to randomly transform the disadvantaged individuals in the population into the dominant individuals. The performance of MSGJO algorithm is verified both on classical and CEC test functions (CEC2019 and CEC2022). Meanwhile, when applied to path planning problems, the proposed algorithm can effectively obtain the global optimal and smoother path.

Addressing these challenges requires adopting modern techniques and advancing agricultural research. Although some techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, are increasingly used in agriculture, progress is constrained by the lack of large labelled datasets. This constraint arises because collecting data is often time-consuming, labour-intensive, and requires expert knowledge for data annotation. To mitigate data limitations, transfer learning (TL) offers a viable solution by allowing pre-trained models to be adapted for agricultural applications. Many researchers have demonstrated TL’s potential to advance agriculture. Despite its importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive review, which could be essential to guide researchers in this field. Given the significance and the lack of a review paper, this paper provides a review dedicated to TL in agriculture, offering three main contributions. First, we provide an in-depth background study on TL and its applications in agriculture. Second, we offer a comprehensive examination of TL-based agricultural applications, covering pre-trained models, dataset sources, input image types, implementation platforms, and TL approaches. Third, based on an exploration of the existing studies, we identify the challenges faced when applying TL in agriculture.

Despite the importance of media literacy training for mothers, there has been limited research in this field. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of Self- Paced Learning (SPL) and Community of Inquiry (CoI) methods in teaching media literacy to Iranian mothers. Ninety mothers of 5th-grade elementary school boys in Hamedan city were selected using an available sampling method and randomly assigned to three groups: control, SPL, CoI. The SPL and CoI groups were trained using the adobe connect learning management system over eight 90 minutes’ sessions, while the control group did not receive any training. A media literacy questionnaire, covering the dimensions of use and consumption, analysis, critique, and creation, was used to collect data before and after the intervention. Despite the lack of significant differences in pre-test data analysis ( P > 0.05), post-test data analysis using one-way variance analysis and Bonferroni ‘s post hoc test showed that both the CoI and SPL had a significant effect compared to the control group (P < 0.001). Moreover, the CoI was significantly more effective than the SPL (P < 0.001). This difference was significant across the four dimensions of media literacy: use and consumption, analysis, critique, and creation of media messages (P < 0.001). Based on these findings, it is suggested that problem-based and community-oriented pedagogies should be prioritized by theorists and instructional designers in online media literacy teaching.;"Pedagogical strategy; Mothers’ media literacy; Self- paced learning; Community of inquiry";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

One common way of improving time-series forecasts is to use ensembles. By combining forecasts of different models, for example, calculating the mean forecast, it is possible to get an ensemble that performs better than every single member. This paper further investigates methods of combining multivariate multi-step forecasts from an ensemble of model forecasts using deep learning, specifically supervised and reinforcement learning. We test our two approaches on 5 water levels at small to medium-sized rivers, datasets that have strong seasonality and rare events. Both approaches outperform single models. The supervised approach outperforms naive ensembles and is trained significantly faster than the reinforcement learner.;"Machine learning; Time-series forecasting; Ensemble deep learning; Flood forecasting";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Traditionally, only experts can provide such specifications, contrasting the need for intuitive robot programming in small and medium enterprises. Simulations and visualizations are typical approaches to increase the usability of robot programming frameworks. Thus, we extend our robot programming approach with force and torque visualizations, enabling non-experts to verify and adjust programs for in-contact tasks. In this paper, we contribute a comprehensive comparison of different force/torque visualization techniques and discuss their applications in robot programming systems. Furthermore, we evaluate visualizations of forces and torques generally as well as specifically adapted to our programming concept utilizing two user studies.

This avoidance not only increases anxiety in the long term, but also prevents developers, their teams, and their organizations from accessing the technical and sociocognitive benefits of effective and efficient code reviews. However, software research has not yet empirically examined code review anxiety, and from this, tractable intervention targets and strategies for mitigating code review anxiety. In this study, we present an empirical framework for understanding the factors maintaining and exacerbating code review anxiety. Utilizing a randomized waitlist control trial, we also tested the effectiveness of a novel single-session cognitive-behavioral workshop intervention. Our results show evidence that positive impact can be obtained from a brief intervention and suggest code review anxiety can be successfully mitigated by targeting developers’ cost bias, anxiety self-efficacy, and self-compassion.;"Code review; Anxiety; Software engineering; Developer experience";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Despite numerous factors, including significant environmental concerns, the global share of coal power generation has remained at 40% over the past four decades. Efficient and clean coal combustion is a high priority wherever coal is used as a fuel. An improved low-power boiler design has been proposed to enhance efficiency during fixed-bed coal combustion. This design reduces harmful emissions into the atmosphere by optimizing parameters and operating modes. In this study, mathematical modeling of gas velocity and temperature distribution during fixed-bed coal combustion was conducted for a conventional grate system and an improved grate-free system. Experimental methods were employed to develop descriptive airflow models in the fixed coal layer, considering nozzle diameter and air supply pressure in the furnace chamber without a grate system. Comparative evaluations of fixed-bed coal combustion rates were performed using an experimental laboratory setup with both grate and grate-free stove systems.;"Fixed-bed coal; Grate system; Air supply to coal layer; Mechanical loss";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The hybrid DC circuit breaker, as the most promising DC circuit breaker, can effectively isolate and remove the faults that occur in DC power grids. At present, hybrid DC circuit breakers can be divided into two types: two port and multiport. Two-port DC circuit breakers are used in a single line and have the advantages of simple and flexible control. Multiport DC circuit breakers are used at the DC bus and control the fault isolation operation of multiple lines connected to the bus. When compared to two-port DC circuit breakers, multiport DC circuit breakers significantly reduce the number of configurations, reduce costs, and occupy less space. First, this article classifies hybrid DC circuit breakers into two-port and multiport categories, and refines and organizes the two major categories. Then, it analyzes the functionality, reliability, control complexity, and economy of each scheme based on the topology structures proposed in the current literature. Finally, prospects for future research on hybrid DC circuit breakers are presented.;"DC transmission; Fault current interruption; DC circuit breaker";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The BEO algorithm combines the biological laws of the black eagle and mathematical transformations to guide the search behaviour of the particles. The highly adaptive BEO algorithm has strong optimisation capabilities due to its unique algorithmic structure and novel iterative approach. In the performance testing experiments of the BEO algorithm, this paper firstly conducts the parametric analysis experiments of the BEO algorithm, then analyses the complexity of the BEO algorithm, and finally conducts a comprehensive testing of the performance of the BEO algorithm on 30 CEC2017 test functions with the widest variety of functions and 12 newest CEC2022 test functions, and its performance is compared with the seven state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The test results show that the convergence accuracy of the BEO algorithm reaches the theoretical value in 100% of unimodal functions, the convergence accuracy is higher than the comparison algorithm in 78.95% of complex functions, and the standard deviation ranks in the top three in 90.48% of functions, which demonstrates the outstanding local optimisation ability, global optimisation ability and stability of BEO algorithm. Meanwhile, the BEO algorithm also maintains a fast convergence speed. However, the complexity analysis shows that the BEO algorithm has the disadvantage of slightly higher complexity. In order to verify the optimisation ability of the BEO algorithm in real engineering problems, we used the BEO algorithm to deal with four complex engineering design problems. The experimental results show that the BEO algorithm has excellent convergence accuracy and stability when dealing with real engineering problems, but the real-time performance is slightly below average. Therefore, the BEO algorithm is optimal for handling non-real-time engineering optimisation problems.

However, the complexity and dynamics of cyberspace make it extremely challenging to generate unique, robust, and tamper-resistant device fingerprints. In this paper, we propose a cryptographic device fingerprinting framework for network devices, which utilizes triplet network to cluster the feature information of data samples into embeddings, and then apply fuzzy extractors to generate a cryptographic fingerprint for each device based on the feature information in each cluster. In order to overcome the discontinuity of embeddings in Hamming space output by triples networks, which degrades the robustness of fingerprints, we use gray code to transform embeddings before applying fuzzy extractors. The experimental results show that the method proposed can obtain unique and robust fingerprint encoding for the same type of device in noisy environments, and supports incremental fingerprint encoding for newly added devices through a small number of sample learning. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy reaches 99.99%, and the histogram of generated fingerprints conform to the Gaussian distribution, which reflects the excellent cryptographic characteristics.;"Device fingerprinting; Fuzzy extractor; Hamming space; Gray code; Impersonation attack";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This longitudinal and in-depth case study, focusing on the adoption and technology continuation of Robotic Process Automation, encompasses 25 interviews and complementary data collected between 2021 and 2023 in a medium-sized public company. The study’s findings underscore that the adoption of technology and its acceptance would greatly benefit from an increased understanding of the diverse challenges that emerge during long-term technological integration, rather than merely relying on initial adoption decisions. Of particular significance is the evolving role and nature of resistance to change over time, as well as the hesitancy in making decisions – both of which have notable implications for the rate of automation adoption. To mitigate resistance toward disruptive innovations, proactive management should, during the early stages, elucidate the reasons for apprehension, communicate the advantages gained by employees, and invest in relatively straightforward implementations that build knowledge and engender trust within the organization. The advent of 4IR innovations necessitates prompt and adaptable resource planning. It is improbable that organizations will achieve success in their adoption journey if they solely rely on outsourced technical competence.;"Technology adoption; Resistance to Change; Robotic Process Automation; Fourth Industrial Revolution; IT management";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Nowadays, many studies oriented on soft-body robotics have focused on origami patterns, since the most significant characteristics of origami robotic systems are compliant and lightweight. And it is well known to all that origami art can emulate some living patterns, such as paper cranes, snakes, and insects. Those we call bioinspired mechanisms can be combined with origami pattern design perfectly. The manipulator used in this paper originated from the elephant trunk, which is a remarkable tool to manipulate diverse objects dexterously despite their dimension, structure, or weight. By applying origami patterns and fabrication, I made a manipulator that can transform from a simple planar plane to a complicated 3D structure with extremely lightweight, reliable compactness, scalable configuration, and a single degree of freedom. Moreover, to combine three such manipulators and make a grasper and realize the simultaneous curling motion of the three “fingers,” I designed a corresponding actuation system and analyzed its capability by theoretical modeling and simulation.;"Origami; Bioinspired mechanisms; Soft-body robotics; Curling motion";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the traditional resource scheduling system, because of the slow decision-making, it is difficult to meet the needs of the actual situation, especially in the face of emergencies, the traditional resource scheduling methods have great disadvantages. In order to solve the above problems, this paper takes emergency resource scheduling, a prominent scheduling problem, as an example. Based on Vague set theory and adaptive grid particle swarm optimization algorithm, a multi-objective emergency resource scheduling model is constructed under different conditions. This model can not only integrate the advantages of Vague set theory in dealing with uncertain problems, but also retain the advantages of adaptive grid particle swarm optimization that can solve multi-objective optimization problems and can quickly converge. The research results show that compared with the traditional resource scheduling optimization algorithm, the emergency resource scheduling model has higher resolution accuracy, more reasonable resource allocation, higher efficiency and faster speed in dealing with emergency events than the traditional resource scheduling model. Compared with the conventional fuzzy theory emergency resource scheduling model, its handling speed has increased by more than 3.82 times.;"Resource scheduling; Vague set theory; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Model; Multi objective";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this study, we applied a social media intelligence-based methodology to analyze startups’ content and to understand how their communication strategies may differ during their scaling process. To understand if a startup’s social media content reflects its current business maturation position, we first defined an adequate life cycle model for startups based on funding rounds and product maturity. Using Twitter as the source of information and selecting a sample of known Portuguese IT startups at different phases of their life cycle, we analyzed their Twitter data. After preprocessing the data, using latent Dirichlet allocation, topic modeling techniques enabled the categorization of the data according to the topics arising in the published contents of the startups, making it possible to discover that contents can be grouped into five specific topics: “Fintech and ML,” “IT,” “Business Operations,” “Product/Service R&D,” and “Bank and Funding.” By comparing those profiles against the startup’s life cycle, we were able to understand how contents change over time. This provided a diachronic profile for each company, showing that while certain topics remain prevalent in the startup’s scaling, others depend on a particular phase of the startup’s cycle. Our analysis revealed that startups’ social media content differs along their life cycle, highlighting the importance of understanding how startups use social media at different stages of their development.;"Topic modeling; Social media; Startups; Life cycle model; Twitter data";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
143;Enterprise innovation evaluation method based on swarm optimization algorithm and artificial neural network;10.1007/s00521-023-08317-2;Springer;"Zhang, Qiansha; Zeng, Xiaoxia; Lo, Wei; Fan, Binbin";Enterprise innovation evaluation method based on swarm optimization algorithm and artificial neural network;2023;Neural Computing and Applications;Promoting the development of enterprises is a common task of all countries in the world, and the government has always taken promoting enterprise development as a long-term strategy. With the development for market, as an integral part of the social market economy, enterprises have made great contributions to the rapid of national economy. The enterprises are increasing, but the market competition is becoming increasingly fierce, and the weaknesses of enterprises such as limited scale, lax management and difficult financing are constantly highlighted. The appearance of these problems makes enterprises encounter many bottleneck problems in the process of development. Innovation, as the inexhaustible power of enterprise development, plays a significant role in enterprise growth, it is the key to solving the bottleneck problem of enterprise development. If an enterprise wants to achieve considerable development, it must innovate and enhance its competitiveness through innovation. In this context, how to evaluate enterprise innovation has become an important work. This work proposes an IPSO-ATT-MSCNN network via PSO from swarm optimization algorithm and artificial neural network to evaluate enterprise innovation. First, this work designs a multi-scale convolutional neural network (ATT-MSNN) via attention mechanism. This method uses multi-scale convolution to extract features of different scales, which improves the richness of features. This adds attention mechanisms to enhance useful features and reduce the impact of unwanted features such as noise. Second, in view of the performance degradation caused by the random initialization, this paper uses improved PSO algorithm to optimize the initial parameters. Third, this work proposes a series of strategies for promoting enterprise innovation. Finally, this work carried out a comprehensive and systematic experiment for the designed method, and the experiment verified the superiority of this method.;"Enterprise innovation evaluation; PSO; CNN; Attention mechanism";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

S.; Nkrumah, S. K.; Davis, F.";Competence of Traditional Automobile Practitioners in Maintenance of Automatic Transmission Drives and Implications for Transportation Planning in Ghana;2023;Sustainable Education and Development – Sustainable Industrialization and Innovation;"Purpose: This study investigates the extent of patronage of Automatic Transmission Drives (ATDs) and assesses the competence of automobile maintenance practitioners in the diagnosis and repair of automatic transmission vehicles in Ghana. Design/Methodology/Approach: A combination of research methods comprising interviews, questionnaire and face-to-face dialogue were employed in collecting data from automatic transmission repair and servicing garages. A total of 1000 questionnaires were administered to four automobile stakeholders, with 983 responses received from vehicle operators (536), wayside mechanics (202), used vehicle importers (232) and new car dealers (13) in five cities in Ghana specifically, Takoradi, Kumasi, Tema, Tamale and Accra. The quota sampling technique was used in sampling respondents from the general population in these cities. Analysis of variance, chi-square and basic charts were used to analyse and interpret trends in the data. Findings: The study revealed that the degree of patronage of ATDs showed a linear relation of y = 52.239x − 105743 over the period 2007 to 2019, an indication that the number of ATDs sold has been increasing at an average rate of 52 ATDs per year for each garage over the period. Vehicle operators classified 1.9% of wayside mechanics and 59.5% of dealers, respectively, as competent in repair of ATDs. Similarly, 66% of vehicle operators patronize wayside mechanics with the claim that their service charges are affordable, while 3% indicated that they can afford the charges of the dealers. Implications/Research Limitations: The study focus on the challenges associated with the maintenance of automatic transmission drives in Ghana. Practical Implications: The configurations of the electronics and mechanical components of the automatic transmission vehicles of different manufacturers are not standardized; however, there are basic principles in their operations which can be taught to the wayside mechanics. Social Implications: Since the wayside mechanics are unable to detect and deal with complex problems associated with automatic transmission vehicles, the government should institute regular problem-based training and refresher courses for the wayside mechanics through engagement with the appropriate educational institutions. Originality/Value: Although there have been some previous studies covering the automatic transmission drives in Ghana, they have not covered the competence of maintenance practitioners which is captured in this study.";"Automatic; Garages; Transmission drives; Vehicle importers; Vehicle operators";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Various artificial intelligence (AI) models have been proposed to forecast the short-term load, but little research has been conducted to investigate the effect of environmental factors like extreme weather. We aim to identify the most accurate AI models, discuss their implications for grid safety, and analyze the performance of the most accurate AI models under hot and cold wave conditions. Based on the experiment, we use Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and daily percentage error as measurement methods to evaluate the accuracy and stability of the model. We observe that the Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model outperforms XgBoosting and Support vector machines (SVM) to forecast load at the cost of unstable daily percentage errors when extreme weather conditions occur. The grid operators who need to develop more accurate forecasting models and discuss the implications of short-term load forecasting for grid safety can benefit from this finding.;"Grid safety; load forecasting; AI models; extreme weather condition";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As a result, e-learning tools and platforms were explored to keep students engaged in learning during this pandemic. Although this virtual teaching–learning adaptation is not by choice and challenging for both educators and students, modern technology has encouraged us to explore a new interactive way of delivering knowledge and continue students’ learning engagement. This paper focuses on the alternative teaching methods that have been conducted in Architecture Measured Drawing, which traditionally relies on physical interactions and interaction in the form of collaborative work in-studio learning and field trips. A case study of one (1) private university conducted the Architecture Measured course online in response to the pandemic has been investigated. This paper aims to identify the teaching and learning methods of this course during the pandemic and to analyze the level of students’ engagement throughout the course.

Service ecosystems constantly evolve driven by value and present many nonlinear responses, where inadvertent perturbations may lead to significant changes. This paper proposes a nonlinear dynamical model of value-driven service ecosystem evolution inspired by the energy flow of natural ecosystems, thereby explaining stability changes based on nonlinear features from the perspective of ecosystems. The model considers the nonlinear features, including interdependence and mutation of services and demands, and time delay due to service development. Further, we use stability and bifurcation theories to study the critical conditions under which parameter changes lead to phase transitions. In addition, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the model and the correctness of the phase transition conditions. Through this method, service ecosystem managers can accurately predict the inflection point of the system from stable to unstable. Our method provides a novel way for the evaluation and governance of service ecosystems to have better universality and interpretability than current data-based mining methods and time series models based on neural networks.;"Service Ecosystem; Nonlinear Dynamical Model; Phase Transition; Time Delay; Numerical Simulation";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

When the system should be maintained is very important because, in the case of early maintenance, there are losses due to the replacement of the unworn machines, while in the case of late maintenance, the wear of the component affects the whole machine and the machine must be completely replaced, therefore it is important when to perform maintenance on the system. To decide when to maintain, we need to get information on the components from the system and this information can be obtained from the system about whether there is a need for maintenance with the help of sensors, but it is not economically feasible to install the sensors on each component. I propose a new policy that receives partial information from the system regarding conditional-based maintenance. I compare this policy with its subset of the classical conditional-based maintenance policy by doing numerical experimentation. I will also analyze how components with different reliability affect the system. In this study, conditional-based maintenance policies were created for maintenance work based on motor machinery driven, which was previously maintained with the Fuzzy Inference system.;"Conditional based maintenance; Fuzzy logic; Corrective maintenance; Preventive maintenance";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Case of UAS Pilots in UAM Operations;2023;Engineering Psychology and Cognitive Ergonomics;In our days, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) face an unprecedented evolution not only regarding to the UAS that are being designed but also regarding to the variety of operations in which they are used. Every pilot both in manned and unmanned aviation must be able to perform three critical actions during the whole duration of a flight (i.e., ‘Aviate’ - ‘Navigate’ - ‘Communicate’). For these tasks, situational awareness (SA) is of paramount importance. SA in UAS operations is much harder to be acquired due to the absence of any physical stimulus. The effects of this special condition are expected to be handled by a proper Human Machine Interface (HMI). This work is focused on Urban Air Mobility (UAM). Even though UAM will be executed initially with a pilot inboard, the examination of Human Factors (HF) would be relevant even in totally unmanned operations. HMI along with Data link and Communication during UAM operations proved to significantly affect pilots’ SA and thus flight safety. This work also reveals the lack of proper simulators for pilot training in UAM flights and finally it considers that HMI, Data link and Communication may not affect equally every phase of flight.;"Flight Safety; Safety Risk; Human Error; Decision-Making; Urban Air Mobility; Data Link; Communication";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Past studies have shown that WOA performs well in a number of optimization problems. However, it is difficult for WOA to completely free itself from the problems of insufficient convergence accuracy and premature convergence when solving global optimization problems. To address these issues, a hybrid whale optimization algorithm based on symbiotic strategy (HWOAMS) is proposed in this paper. The main idea of the proposed method is to combine the improved symbiotic organisms search algorithm (SOS) with the whale optimization algorithm thus enhancing the search ability of WOA. First, an improved symbiotic phase based on Lévy flight and chaos strategy is introduced into the exploration process to enhance the global search capability; Second, an improved mutualism phase based on Brownian motion is used instead of the original shrinking encircling phase to achieve better local exploitation. Third, an improved parasitic phase based on a modified global optimal spiral operator strategy is embedded in the spiral updating position phase to help the algorithm further improve the exploitation efficiency and convergence accuracy. Finally, a global search strategy is proposed to help the algorithm better balance exploration and exploitation. To establish the effectiveness of the new algorithm, extensive simulation experiments are conducted on HWOAMS using the classical function test set, the CEC 2019 function set and four classical engineering problems. Numerical evaluation results indicate that HWOAMS outperforms 18 other algorithms in terms of local optimum avoidance ability and convergence accuracy in a majority of cases, and has better search performance.";"Whale optimization algorithm; Symbiotic organisms search algorithm; Diversity; Global optimization problem";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Node decoupling for (NoRD) efficient power-supplying of nodes offers a evade network to avoid sleepy nodes (Chen and Pinkston in NoRD: Node-node decoupling for effective power-gating of on-chip nodes, in Intl, Symp, On Microarchitecture (MICRO), 2012). Though, it obtains a huge latency as well as restricted scalability. In addition, it enhances energy utilization. To defeat this problem, Energy Efficient and Delay Aware Optimization Reverse Routing Strategy (EEOS) is proposed for forecasting link quality in WSN. The main objective of this research is to design a Multi-hop Reverse Routing Technique in WSN. The reverse routing technique avoids the amount of retransmission. Forecasting link quality is used to measure the link quality by Estimating Communication Count (ECC), energy, and delay. This technique enhances routing, link stability, and energy efficiency and minimizes network congestion. It supports Quality of Service (QoS) necessities of energy control, traffic arrangement, and route allotment. In this scheme, the Signal-to-Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) assists in measuring the quality of a wireless connection. In addition, the route link score is used to form the route from sender to receiver. The reverse routing also provides an efficient route. Simulation results prove that the EEOS minimizes both the delay and the energy utilization and increases the network throughput compared to the baseline protocol.;"Energy efficiency; Wireless sensor network; Forecasting link quality; Signal to interference and noise ratio; Delay analysis; Reverse routing; Simulation analysis";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Recently, automation is being used to augment knowledge work, which includes high-level cognitive activities. As automated systems are being extended to perform skill-based tasks, the work required of humans may be altered, potentially affecting their cognitive workloads. Researchers have investigated the influences of automation on cognitive workload across different domains and tasks by assessing changes in task performance, perceived (subjective) workload, and physiological states. A major challenge in comparing results and drawing inferences across studies is that a profusion of measures is often used to assess cognitive workload. The experimental tasks employed across many domains further complicates synthesizing findings. Thus, the aim of this review is to examine how cognitive workload is assessed when at least two different measures of cognitive workload are used in research focused on human-automated knowledge work. To accomplish this aim, the various approaches employed to measure cognitive workload were first summarized. Then, automated and cognitive experimental tasks were classified, utilizing existing frameworks, to identify associations, dissociations, and insensitivities across task types. Finally, recommendations were provided for aligning task types, study designs, and measurement selections, along with expanding the types of tasks and measures used when studying automation applications supporting knowledge work.;"Cognitive workload; Automation; Human-automated systems; Knowledge work; Measurement";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In such cases, it is necessary to consider processing and assembly in an integrated manner, and directly formulate flexible scheduling solutions according to the precedence constraints of BOM (PCB). To design such integrated scheduling method for personalized products with no-wait constraints (ISMPNC), firstly, a mathematical model considering both no-wait constraints and flexible machines is established, then, the event-based rescheduling rule (ERR) is used to deal with dynamic production tasks; finally, to solve the mathematical model, the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm with enhancements is proposed. Hence, a virtual grouping-based encoding method is designed to handle the precedence constraints when the number of no-wait predecessors is greater than one; a first-time-fit decoding method based on overlapping time is proposed to guarantee that no-wait operations always meet the precedence and no-wait constraints after decoding; a discrete differential equation based on the Hemming distance is proposed so that the ABC is capable of handling discrete encoding spaces; a neighborhood action based on key product moving is proposed and embedded into the ABC to enhance the local search capability. The operation research solver OR-Tools is used to verify the correctness of the mathematical model.

No test was conducted, and only performance-based evaluative methods were used throughout the two-semester course of one academic year. A survey was administered to the students after the course experience, obtaining 67 valid responses. AI research tools were also applied to the analyzes, to explore their future use. A high level of positivity toward the PA course design was obtained. Besides, the design succeeded in building students’ self-efficacy and helping them become more strategic in using the language. The perceived progress was also confirmed by an objective test held outside the current research. Furthermore, the students admitted some utility in test-based assessment, proving, on average, that the combinatory design of 75–85% PAs and 15–25% tests would be ideal. PA-centred course design has significant potential to deepen students’ learning. It provides an antithesis to a heavily test-centred teaching approach, which could limit students’ learning. It suggests that digital-based PAs be viable solutions, when meeting for tests is not feasible under emergencies, including worldwide pandemics.;"Performance assessment; Blended learning; Learning outcomes; Instructional design; AI; Emergency";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The evil side of this new technique poses another popular study, i.e., DeepFake detection aiming to identify the fake faces from the real ones. With the rapid development of the DeepFake-related studies in the community, both sides (i.e., DeepFake generation and detection) have formed the relationship of battleground, pushing the improvements of each other and inspiring new directions, e.g., the evasion of DeepFake detection. Nevertheless, the overview of such battleground and the new direction is unclear and neglected by recent surveys due to the rapid increase of related publications, limiting the in-depth understanding of the tendency and future works. To fill this gap, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview and detailed analysis of the research work on the topic of DeepFake generation, DeepFake detection as well as evasion of DeepFake detection, with more than 318 research papers carefully surveyed. We present the taxonomy of various DeepFake generation methods and the categorization of various DeepFake detection methods, and more importantly, we showcase the battleground between the two parties with detailed interactions between the adversaries (DeepFake generation) and the defenders (DeepFake detection). The battleground allows fresh perspective into the latest landscape of the DeepFake research and can provide valuable analysis towards the research challenges and opportunities as well as research trends and future directions. We also elaborately design interactive diagrams ( http://www.xujuefei.com/dfsurvey ) to allow researchers to explore their own interests on popular DeepFake generators or detectors.;"DeepFake Generation; DeepFake Detection; Face; Misinformation; Disinformation; DeepFakes";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

F.; Tao, Min; Chang, Ching-Ter";A Hybrid AHP–FCE–WMCGP Approach for Internal Auditor Selection: A Generic Framework;2022;International Journal of Fuzzy Systems;Internal audit function is an important cornerstone of corporate governance. Selecting qualified internal audit professionals has become a key success factor for any organization. However, research on the selection of internal auditors has limited exposure in the literature. In addition, prior research on personnel selection has only focused on applying traditional ranking methods, which calculate the overall utility value for each candidate and rank candidates in terms of the score. Little has been done for considering management’s goals regarding the attributes of the desired candidate. A robust model has not been constructed to address multiple aspiration levels for each goal in the classical personnel selection process. To fill these gaps, a novel generic framework is presented to evaluate and select ideal internal auditors, based on the analytic hierarchy process, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, and weighted multi-choice goal programming. A case study is conducted to validate the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed hybrid approach can assist decision-makers in selecting the candidate who is a good match for organizational needs. The implications of the paper are not restricted to the selection of internal auditors.;"Human resource planning; Goal programming; Analytic hierarchy process; Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For complexity and particularity, it is difficult to form such parts. It is also more likely to cause excessive warpage deformation, affecting the molding quality and performance. The automobile audio shell is a typical slender, cantilevered, thin-walled plastic part. When the mold structure and material are determined, optimizing its injection molding process is the most economical and effective method to manufacture the products with the optimum properties. In order to minimize the warpage deformation, the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and genetic algorithm (GA) were adopted to optimize the injection molding process parameters. In particular, considering the high-dimensional nonlinear relationship between the process parameters and the warpage, the ANFIS is constructed as the prediction model of the warpage. Then, the GA is used to globally optimize the prediction model to determine the optimal process parameters. The results show that the optimization method based on ANFIS-GA has a good performance. The warpage is reduced to 0.0925 mm while reduced by 88.25 %. The optimal injection molding process parameters are used for simulation and manufacture, verifying the effectiveness and reliability of the optimization method.;"Injection molding process; Warpage deformation; ANFIS; GA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Firstly, an online thickness prediction model of OSELM is established based on the data collected from hot rolling site. Next, in order to improve the model accuracy and stability, an ISSA method is proposed to optimize the weights and the biases of OSELM to reduce the error between the model and actual production process. On this basis, a self-learning method is applied to further improve the prediction accuracy. Finally, the validity of the ISSA-OSELM with self-learning was verified by simulation.

167;Historical data based approach to mitigate stragglers from the Reduce phase of MapReduce in a heterogeneous Hadoop cluster;10.1007/s10586-021-03530-x;Springer;"Bawankule, Kamalakant Laxman; Dewang, Rupesh Kumar; Singh, Anil Kumar";Historical data based approach to mitigate stragglers from the Reduce phase of MapReduce in a heterogeneous Hadoop cluster;2022;Cluster Computing;Hadoop MapReduce processes data on the cluster of commodity hardware (node) in two phases using Map and Reduce tasks. Yet another resource negotiator (YARN), a dynamic resource manager, allocates resources for Map tasks by preserving the data locality. In contrast, it allocates resources to schedule the Reduce tasks on any node in the cluster. The policy’s performance is better in a homogeneous environment, where the nodes’ computing capabilities are identical. However, its performance degrades in a heterogeneous environment when it allocates the containers for scheduling the Reduce tasks on any node that slowdowns the Reduce tasks execution and leads to computational skew. To mitigate the computational skew from the Reduce phase of MapReduce, we proposed the Historical data based Reduce tasks scheduling (HDRTS) technique. The technique has two algorithms: The first algorithm finds node average response time (NART) of each node by interpreting the job history information. The second algorithm allocates the resource on the faster processing node (FPN) to schedule the Reduce tasks. To evaluate the policy’s performance, we have used a very popular benchmark, i.e., the HiBench benchmark suite. Finally, compared with Hadoop’s default policy and several other policies, the proposed HDRTS policy reduces the Reduce tasks execution time for reduce-input-heavy jobs by nearly 25% to 37% significantly. Finally, it mitigates the computational skew and the stragglers from Reduce phase of MapReduce in the heterogeneous environments.;"Data locality based scheduler (DLBS); Hadoop; Historical data based Reduce tasks scheduling (HDRTS); Heterogeneous environment; MapReduce; Node average response time (NART); Total average response time (TART); Heterogeneous cluster";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this approach, the shape and topology layout of structures are explicitly optimized by growth evolution of moving morphable components. To this end, a competition criterion is developed to optimize the structural layout from two options: adding several new components or changing the current layout. In addition, some numerical technqiues are also developed to preserve the stability of the iterative process. The present topology optimization approach allows rational generation of new components and does not require a specific distribution of components in the initial design, which is compulsory for the conventional MMC method. Three numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The optimization results indicate that the proposed method does have the potential to improve the existing MMC-based explicit topology optimization framework by eliminating the initial design dependency of optimal solutions.;"Topology optimization; Moving morphable component (MMC); Component introduction mechanism";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Traditional assessment models consider the static and demographic data to predict the likelihood of customer turning to bad debtors. This paper proposes a novel fog assisted IoT based three- tier framework for credit risk assessment that can be deployed for evaluating the risk of both existing borrowers and new applicants. The RFM (Recenecy, Frequency, Monetary) and behavioral data are captured through User Device layer. Real time behaviour score of existing borrowers is computed to find cluster of risky clients who are indulged in hefty spending and possess an unfavorable behaviour. Fog layer sends alert messages to high risky borrowers as well as to the dealing officers in banks. ASW (Average Silhouette Width) metric is utilized to assess quality of clusters. At the cloud layer, heat map analysis is performed to find risky geographical areas where majority of existing borrowers are prone to overspending propensity. The identified (risky/non-risky) region codes are augmented to the demographic details of new loan applicants to classify them as potential High risky/Moderate Risky/Low risky/No Risk. Experimental results reveal that the inclusion of region code enhances accuracy from 0.8867 to 0.9244. AUC (Area under curve) and other vital statistical measures are also elevated. Additionally, Gini Coefficient has been computed for measuring region wise disparity in income and expenditure.;"Behaviour scoring; Cloud computing; Fog computing; Geo demographic analysis; IoT based Credit risk assessment";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
170;An Improved Adaptive Controller Design for Enhancing Dynamic Stability of Grid-Connected MGs;10.1007/s40998-021-00468-z;Springer;"Mobini-Serajy, Zahra; Radmehr, Mehdi; Ghorbani, Alireza";An Improved Adaptive Controller Design for Enhancing Dynamic Stability of Grid-Connected MGs;2022;Iranian Journal of Science and Technology, Transactions of Electrical Engineering;Naturally, the occurrence of events in the distribution network such as symmetrical three phase fault, load fluctuation, distributed generation and resources forced outage threatens the dynamic stability (DS) of downstream hybrid micro-grids (MGs). To maintain DS of MGs at the occurrence moment of destructive events, an appropriate controller should be designed and applied. This paper proposes an improved controller that increases the DS margins for the hybrid MGs, main feature of mention controller is robustness operation against distribution structural changes as possible as. The main contribution of this paper is the design of an improved multi-level controller to response the contingency events. Primary level has a fast response that is related to system stability provision. Secondary level has slower response that is applied for reducing the system frequency offset to zero. Tertiary level coordinates the control systems together at the new operating point. In AC part of hybrid MGs, voltage-frequency drop control as the primary level control and nonlinear complementary adaptive control are used as a secondary level control and finally a third level control is applied to the micro-grid energy storage equipment. In DC part of hybrid MGs, a boost converter with nonlinear back-step based control is used in which all system non-ideals are taken into account. For effective evaluation of the proposed controller, numerical studies have been performed on two test hybrid MGs under various operation scenarios. It is concluded that the proposed multi-level controller has a simple design and good accuracy and response time to enhance the DS of MG, efficiently.;"Improved controller; Dynamic stability (DS); Hybrid micro-grids (MGs); And power–frequency response; Voltage source converter (VSC)";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Without institutional support, the MOOCs have a high dropout rate of 90 – 95 percent, leading to low academic impact. The role of academic library in the integration of MOOCs in the higher education curriculum has not been clearly defined in the literature, and for this reason there has been no attempt to define the success of such MOOC services of academic libraries. The contribution of this study to the academic literature is development of a list of ‘Academic Library MOOC Services’ (ALMS) and attempt to create an ‘ALMS – Success Scale’ based on DeLone and McLean Information Systems Success Model. The Research Model derived from the findings of the literature has been tested empirically using Confirmatory Factor Analysis method. 'MOOC Infrastructure Services', 'MOOC Information Services' and, 'MOOC Learner Support Services' are the key drivers for increasing 'Learner Intention to Use ALMS', which determines the level of 'Learner Satisfaction'. Learner Satisfaction is measured to estimate the success of the library's MOOC services.

The new paradigm of Line-less Mobile Assembly Systems (LMAS) provides the necessary changeability, by mobilizing multipurpose resources and realizing adaptive system behavior. A holistic allocation of tasks to resources is introduced by extending the allocation through a study of its spatial feasibility. To evaluate the state of the art and to assess the transferability of theoretical task allocation approaches to industrial assembly, key criteria are identified. The presented approach for dynamic task allocation for cooperating, heterogeneous assembly resources expands existing concepts by the consideration of spatial motion constraints and cooperative behavior. Through the identification of cooperatively solvable tasks, the solution space for allocation is expanded, and a reduction of non-value-adding waiting times is expected. The potential of reconfigurable resources is leveraged through incremental re-auctioning of tasks, enabling dynamic reaction to changes, such as process delays, altered task prioritization or downtimes of resources. Interdependencies between task allocation, trajectory and formation planning are included through verification of spatial feasibility. The verification contains the confirmation of an executable formation of allocated resources as well as collision-free trajectories to reach the planned formation.;"Line-less Mobile Assembly Systems (LMAS); Multi-robot task allocation; Formation planning; Mobile robots";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Among many camber morphing wing concepts, shape changing fingerlike mechanisms consist of components, such as torsion bars, bushings, bearings, and joints, all of which exhibit damping and stiffness nonlinearities that are dependent on excitation amplitude. These nonlinearities make the dynamic response difficult to model accurately with traditional simulation approaches. As a result, at high excitation levels, linear finite element models may be inaccurate, and a nonlinear modeling approach is required to capture the necessary physics. This work seeks to better understand the influence of nonlinearity on the effective damping and natural frequency of the morphing wing through the use of quasi-static modal analysis and model reduction techniques that employ multipoint constraints (i.e., spider elements). With over 500,000 elements and 39 frictional contact surfaces, this represents one of the most complicated models to which these methods have been applied to date.

178;Numerical Model of Finned Tubular Shear Panel Damper for Multi-direction Seismic Excitation;10.1007/978-981-16-7924-7_49;Springer;"Emilidardi, A. M.; Fajar, A. S.; Awaludin, A.; Satyarno, I.; Sunarso, M.";Numerical Model of Finned Tubular Shear Panel Damper for Multi-direction Seismic Excitation;2022;Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Sustainable Civil Engineering Structures and Construction Materials;The earthquake has become a problem in many countries in the world, especially triggering loss of infrastructure due to damage or collapse. In the bridge structure, the critical part that provokes structural damage or collapse occurrence is the plastic hinge of the pier. The main problem is the pier of the bridge has limited ductility, so they are not able to resist a significant earthquake. The application of a passive energy dissipation device is one solution alternative to solve the problem, i.e., shear panel damper (SPD). Currently, SPD is designed to damp seismic forces only in one direction. However, in the real case, the seismic force that works on SPD installed in bridge structure works in multi-direction. This paper discusses an analytical study of two-directional finned tubular shear panel damper (FTSPD) as energy dissipation and resistance devices in the pier of bridges. The beneficial aspects of FTSPD are high energy dissipation capacity, high strength, sufficient ductility, and economical cost. In this study, FTSPD is designed into four models, namely, without fins, four vertical fins, six vertical fins, and eight vertical fins. For this purpose, finite element software (ABAQUS) was conducted to investigate the energy dissipation capacity, damping capacity, ductility, and strength of FTSPD. The main component of the models is tubular steel, which uses low-yield strength LY225, but its plates and fins using S355. In realizing non-linear material behavior, metal plasticity with combined isotropic and kinematic hardening was adopted. Moreover, to calculate the nominal energy dissipation and damping capacity of each model, forty-cyclic loadings on the top of FTSPD were used. The FEM simulation result found that inelastic buckling occurred in TSPD, which not uses fins. On the other hand, FTSPD, which employs more fins, could achieve more high dissipation energy and ductility. This study shows that the implementation of fins can delay buckling occurrence and improve energy dissipation capacity, damping capacity, and ductility of FTSPD. With those achievements of FTSPD, the structural bridge damage under severe earthquake excitation expected could be reduced by implementing FTSPD on a bridge structure.;"Finned tubular shear panel damper; Finite element analysis; Energy dissipation; Damping capacity";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

180;The Effect of Electrode Movements on Electrical Characteristics of a Submerged Arc Furnace;10.1007/s11837-021-04818-4;Springer;"Tesfahunegn, Y. A.; Magnusson, T.; Tangstad, M.; Saevarsdottir, G.";The Effect of Electrode Movements on Electrical Characteristics of a Submerged Arc Furnace;2021;JOM;This work discusses the effect of electrode position on the electrical characteristics of a submerged arc furnace. A 3D model has been developed in ANSYS Maxwell using an eddy current solver that considers alternating current. The model includes flexibles, busbars, and the whole furnace. The furnace model contains electrodes, main arcs, craters, crater walls, and side arcs that connect the electrode and crater wall, which are taken into account for each phase. Other furnace parts such as carbon block, steel shell, and alumina brick are also incorporated. The electrical characteristics such as system resistance, active and reactive power distributions, and the power factors are presented. The results showed that between 68% and 65% of the reactive power comes from the far field. The electrodes' contribution to the reactive power is between 3.5% and 6% due to the change of electrode length. Reactive power distributions in carbide and charge are more affected by tip positions than holder positions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Therefore, it is critical for it to be aligned with the Materials Genome Initiative to develop, produce, and deploy high-throughput components. Recognizing a need, this study leverages a feature-based qualification (FBQ) methodology to decompose a complex structure by identifying critical performance-limiting features, for the purpose of reducing the cost and time of DED process qualification. A hybrid-physics-based multi-objective optimization tool was used to predict processing-structure-property relationships in thin-walled builds. The probabilistic ML models achieved targeted predictions with half the sample space when compared with conventional DOEs, while also being 37–50% more reliable with respect to regression tools with linear basis function. Although the current model developed is specific to Ti64 builds in a RPMi557 powder-feed DED machine, the FBQ methodology may be more universally employed to other material-modality combinations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

All lectures, tutorials and other face-to-face skill-based training sections were cancelled and were replaced by the online model. Such a model was only seen as one of the supplementary components for performing arts education in the past. From January 2020, this online pedagogy was inevitably placed to surmount the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The social distancing measures demanded the blended pedagogy into a new online approach, in which the traditional face-to-face teaching to be replaced by synchronous online learning (facilitated by technologies such as Zoom, Cisco Webex, Google Class, Panopto etc.). Meanwhile, to offer opportunities for cognitive participation which allows students to process the learning and be reflective, webinar and innovative performance projects were launched from the concept of ‘flipped classroom and outcome-based education.’ This mixed approach (blended learning, flipped classroom, and outcome-based education) is described as ‘hybrid learning’ in this study. The ‘hybrid learning’ pedagogy is implemented at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts (HKAPA) for all teaching activities in the 2nd semester 2020/2021 to overcome the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A questionnaire survey about how it affected the performing arts education, and how the new pedagogy was implemented took place in July 2020. The survey results from both the teachers (76) and students (163) share lessons, insights, and new understandings on teaching and learning online. Hybrid learning has been widely investigated and researched, yet study on hybrid learning in performing arts such as creative art, theatre art and music, remains insufficient.

Owing to the randomness in the renewable power generation and the EV charging demand, simulation-based policy improvement (SBPI) has been well adopted for making charging decision. However, it is challenging to explore the large action space which grows exponentially with respect to the system scale. We consider this important problem in this paper and make the following contributions. First, we explore the structural property of the problem and develop an urgency index to rank the EVs. Second, we apply three methods to search in the action space. Third, we numerically demonstrate the performance of the urgency index and the search methods, and compare the SBPI methods with the CPLEX-based method. It shows that SBPI improves the base policies in all these cases.;"EV; simulation-based policy improvement; large action space; sampling";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Existing approaches either rely on workflow definitions based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) or require workarounds to implement cyclic structures. In contrast, our system supports cycles natively, avoids workarounds, and as such reduces the complexity of workflow modelling and maintenance. Our algorithm traverses workflow graphs and transforms them iteratively into linear sequences of executable actions. We call these sequences process chains. Our software architecture distributes the process chains to multiple compute nodes in the cloud and oversees their execution. We evaluate our approach by applying it to two practical use cases from the domains of astronomy and engineering. We also compare it with two existing workflow management systems. The evaluation demonstrates that our algorithm is able to execute dynamically changing workflows with cycles and that design and maintenance of complex workflows is easier than with existing solutions. It also shows that our software architecture can run process chains on multiple compute nodes in parallel to significantly speed up the workflow execution. An implementation of our algorithm and the software architecture is available with the Steep Workflow Management System that we released under an open-source license. The resources for the first practical use case are also available as open source for reproduction.;"Scientific workflow management systems; Workflow scheduling; Cloud computing; Distributed systems";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Very few works deal with the problem of moving parts in industrial assembly applications. However, having autonomous robots that are able to execute assembly tasks in dynamic environments could lead to more flexible facilities with reduced implementation efforts for individual products. In this paper, we present a general approach towards autonomous robotic assembly that combines visual and intrinsic tactile sensing to continuously track parts within a single Bayesian framework. Based on this, it is possible to implement object-centric assembly skills that are guided by the estimated poses of the parts, including cases where occlusions block the vision system. In particular, we investigate the application of this approach for peg-in-hole assembly. A tilt-and-align strategy is implemented using a Cartesian impedance controller, and combined with an adaptive path executor. Experimental results with multiple part combinations are provided and analyzed in detail.;"Autonomous assembly; Sequential Monte Carlo; Compliant manipulation; Sensor fusion; Peg-in-hole; Future manufacturing";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In digital fabrication, however, this improvisational negotiation is typically replaced by a virtual simulation that predicts how a material expression can be fabricated, limiting the resulting design language to algorithmic forms. In contrast, we believe that digital fabrication can also produce ‘emergent’ material expressions that are so confounded that they appear slightly differently even when being produced by identical operations. This paper argues that such expressions can be executed by a domain-driven feedback paradigm, which integrates a human-in-the-loop to encode the tacit fabrication knowledge that is generated by reviewing intermediate outcomes. We encode this tacit knowledge by fabrication grammars, rule-based descriptions that causally relate fabrication parameters to qualitative descriptions of material expressions. By documenting a set of Single Point Incremental Forming experiments, this paper demonstrates how emergent material expressions can be controlled by semantically meaningful fabrication grammars, which even can be combined towards purposeful design goals. We believe our findings might allow the digital fabrication of material expressions that appear to have been produced manually or naturally; and support the future sharing of tacit fabrication knowledge.";"Digital fabrication; Computational fabrication; Human–robot interaction; Design thinking; Emergence; Materiality; Material-driven design";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

India has developed more engineering programs that dwell on mathematical analysis, theory and an understanding of the science rather than engineering technology programs which focus on application of science to solve real-world problems. Industries rely on innovation which is all about making incremental modifications to existing solutions with the intention of adding value or improving the efficiency. Thus there is a fundamental disconnect in the expectation of industry from graduating students and the focus of engineering programs. In this paper, we will consider the aspect of industry-readiness of graduating engineers, focusing on three areas of engineering, namely, electronics and communication engineering , Electrical Engineering , and computer science .

They are well-established for the model-driven engineering (MDE) of complex software systems and are supported by numerous commercial and academic tools, such as Simulink, LabVIEW or Ptolemy. In MDE , engineers concentrate on constructing and simulating such models, before application code (or at least a large fraction thereof) is synthesized automatically. However, a significant fraction of today’s legacy system has been coded directly, often using the C language. High-level models that give a quick, accurate overview of how components interact are often out of date or do not exist. This makes it challenging to maintain or extend legacy software, in particular for new team members. To address this problem, we here propose to reverse the classic synthesis path of MDE and to synthesize actor-based dataflow models automatically from source code. Here functions in the code get synthesized into nodes that represent actors manipulating data. Second, we propose to harness the modeling-pragmatic approach, which considers visual models not as static artefacts, but allows interactive, flexible views that also link back to textual descriptions. Thus we propose to synthesize actor models that can vary in level of detail and that allow navigation in the source code. To validate and evaluate our proposals, we implemented these concepts for C analysis in the open source, Eclipse-based KIELER project and conducted a small survey.;"Actor-based dataflow; Program comprehension; Interactive Documentation";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

196;Human Factors Analysis for Aviation Accidents and Incidents in Singapore;10.1007/978-3-030-77932-0_25;Springer;"Mohandas, H. R.; Weng, Tham Kah";Human Factors Analysis for Aviation Accidents and Incidents in Singapore;2021;Engineering Psychology and Cognitive Ergonomics;The aviation industry is an important sector in contributing to a nation’s economy and its growth and development. The continuous improvement in the aviation industry with the adoption of new technology has developed trust and confidence amongst people all over the world. However even with such improvement and technological advances embedded in the aviation industry, accidents still cannot be avoided. An aviation accident is characterized as an incident that is directly related to an aircraft’s service. Aviation accidents are often the result of a number of causes and contributory factors, many of which have a human dimension to them. In some cases, human error is a factor in as high as 70% of aircraft accidents (Feggetter 2007). Hence, the challenge for accident investigators is how best to identify and mitigate the causal sequence of events leading up to an accident. The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) is a general human error framework originally developed and tested within the USA military as a tool for investigating and analysing human causes of aviation accidents (Li et al. 2008). The applicability of HFACS to the analysis of large-scale datasets of incidents and accidents has also been demonstrated in both civil and military aviation environments in Taiwan, India and Australia. Further, this framework has been extended and adapted to analyse the underlying human factors causes in accidents involving remotely piloted aircraft, aviation maintenance and railroad accidents. In Asia, Singapore has a strong and robust economy and operates one of the world’s most successful and recognisable airlines. It is therefore surprising that little is known about human error in the aviation context. Thus, one purpose of the present study is to assess the utility of the HFACS framework as an error analysis and classification tool for accidents/incidents in the aviation industry in Singapore. Specifically, HFACS will be applied to commercial aviation accident and incident records maintained by the Transportation Safety Investigation Bureau (TSIB) of the Ministry of Transport (MOT). The TSIB is the air, marine and rail accidents and incidents investigation authority in Singapore. Its mission is to promote transport safety through the conduct of independent investigations into air, marine and rail accidents and incidents. A comprehensive review of 75 accidents and incidents that occurred between October 2000 and December 2019 in Singapore has just been undertaken. This is currently being analysed within a HFACS context and the findings will be reported here. Thus, the utility of the HFACS framework will be appraised, an overview of the 75 accidents will be given, and more specific detail relating to human error will be reported. At a later stage, these findings will be compared with other countries in Asia where similar data is available. Researchers claim that the HFACS framework bridges the gap between theory and practice by providing safety professionals with a theoretical tool for identifying and classifying human errors in aviation mishaps (Wiegmann and Shappell 2001a , b , c ). The system focuses on both latent and active failures and their interrelationships, thereby facilitating the identification of the underlying causes of human error. The findings from this research will allow safety managers, administrators and other aviation professionals working in airlines, airports and aviation regulatory organizations to analyse their safety programmes’ strengths and weaknesses. This will also contribute to the build-up of a comprehensive database in Southeast Asia. Finally, this study is unprecedented in Singapore and will offer new insights into the nature and trends of human factors in aircraft accidents and incidents.;"Human factors; HFACS; Aviation safety; Accidents and incidents; Air traffic";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To this aim, different scenarios, such as real, remote and virtual labs, are considered to be addressable within an integrated learning environment that focuses on alternative methods (i.e. Serious Games, Self-Regulated and Collaborative Learning) and new technologies (i.e. Open Badges, Mixed Reality and Learning Analytics). To support the design of the laboratory-based learning environment, qualitative interviews were conducted with both expert lecturers and relevant students in the field of engineering, to provide complementary perspectives. These interviews were carried out to analyze the requirements, and to identify possible benefits that relevant stakeholders expect by using these teaching and learning methods and technologies. A qualitative content analysis has been started on the interviews to define which is the perception of the new technologies and teaching methods.

A 100% performance-centred assessment (PA) instructional design is therefore considered a better option. This study examines a PA design wherein no tests are included, and its effects and benefits are investigated from the perspective of students. The two-semester course based on this instructional design was held for one academic year in an undergraduate English programme at a Tokyo university. A survey administered after the course experience obtained 67 valid responses revealing a high level of positivity towards the PA course design. Additionally, the course succeeded in building students’ self-efficacy and language use in a more strategic manner. Students also acknowledged the differences in the functionality between the test and PA methods, signifying a higher level of learning attained. Therefore, it can be concluded that a PA-centred course design has significant potential to deepen learning with skill-based education at the higher education level, providing a viable solution when conducting tests in person is not feasible, as during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.;"Performance-based assessment; Blended learning; Can-Do; AI text mining; Emergency; Language education";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Their vast amount of implementation necessitates a thorough condition monitoring framework to assure their well-being, reduction of costs, increasing their lifetimes and avoiding unwanted stoppages. Intensive research efforts have been focused on motor current signature analysis (MCSA), the technique which utilizes the spectral analysis of the stator current and aims to detect electrical and mechanical defects. Although MCSA is one of the most common and efficient techniques in condition monitoring of induction motors, several drawbacks hinder their applicability and efficiency in certain conditions; one of the most important of which is when the motor faces oscillating loads where fault-related sidebands in MCSA spectrum are misunderstood with the ones due to load oscillation and hence it leads to false indications . In this paper, a new fault detection technique focusing on active and reactive instantaneous power signatures rather than stator current is proposed for the diagnosis of faults in three-phase induction motors and prevention of false indications due to overlapping fault sideband components with those pertained to load oscillations. As a specific case study, a large 2 MW motor in steel production process in Mobarakeh Steel Company, Iran, with a relatively oscillating load is studied. A common fault in induction motors, a broken rotor bar is simulated for verification of the results. Computer simulation is performed using MATLAB based on the proposed case study and both approaches are compared in both healthy and faulty situations, highlighting the advantages of the proposed method.";"Motor Current Signature Analysis; Diagnosis; Instantaneous power; Broken rotor bar; Oscillating load";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The increase in exploration by academicians and industrialists to address various implementation issues and challenges is now vital and transition in many industries has been initiated. Numerous decision-making approaches are evaluated for the major domains of industry, namely , optimization of activity, processes, coordination, network design and marketing issues. With the categorization of the closed-loop supply chain as circular economy and emission reduction, the three factors (environmental, social and economic factors) are evaluated single-handedly.

Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 1 , 94–111 2013 ). However, constructing tutoring systems that are pedagogically effective has been widely recognized as a challenging problem (Murray 2003 ; Murray, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 10 , 98–129, 1999 ). In this paper, we explore the use of computational models of apprentice learning, or computer models that learn interactively from examples and feedback, for authoring expert-models via demonstrations and feedback (Matsuda et al. International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 25 (1), 1–34 2014 ) across a wide range of domains. To support these investigations, we present the Apprentice Learner Architecture, which posits the types of knowledge, performance, and learning components needed for apprentice learning. We use this architecture to create two models: the Decision Tree model, which non-incrementally learns skills, and the Trestle model, which instead learns incrementally. Both models draw on the same small set of prior knowledge (six operators and three types of relational knowledge) to support expert model authoring. Despite their limited prior knowledge, we demonstrate their use for efficiently authoring a novel experimental design tutor and show that they are capable of learning an expert model for seven additional tutoring systems that teach a wide range of knowledge types (associations, categories, and skills) across multiple domains (language, math, engineering, and science). This work shows that apprentice learner models are efficient for authoring tutors that would be difficult to build with existing non-programmer authoring approaches (e.g., experimental design or stoichiometry tutors). Further, we show that these models can be applied to author tutors across eight tutor domains even though they only have a small, fixed set of prior knowledge. This work lays the foundation for new interactive machine-learning based authoring paradigms that empower teachers and other non-programmers to build pedagogically effective educational technologies at scale.";"Authoring tools; Intelligent tutoring systems; Interactive machine learning; Simulated agents";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In real mechanical applications, such RBDO problems are a highly complex task by involving computational difficulties and its resolution requires the use of appropriate optimization techniques. In this paper, a new RBDO solution approach is introduced for mechanical engineering problems. It is a combination of the reliable design space (RDS) technique with an efficient hybrid algorithm (AMDE-NM) based on the adaptive mixed differential evolution (AMDE) and Nelder–Mead local search (NM). First, the RDS strategy is used to turn the RBDO problem into a simple deterministic optimization (SDO) one, through converting the probabilistic constraints to approximate deterministic constraints, while the resolution is then carried out with the AMDE-NM algorithm. The new proposed integrated approach (RDS–AMDE-NM) is able to handle the mixed design variables with continuous, discrete, and integer types. Six mechanical problems with different features are studied to analyze the applicability and the efficiency of RDS–AMDE-NM. The obtained simulation results show the performance of the proposed approach, while new optimal solutions for two RBDO problems are presented. Furthermore, an industry case on a cylindrical spur gear is studied to investigate the reliability of the proposed method in solving real challenging mechanical RBDO problems. The obtained results reveal really that RDS–AMDE-NM is a promising RBDO approach with extensive applicability.;"Reliability-based design optimization; Reliable design space; Adaptive mixed deferential evolution; Nelder–Mead; Mixed design variable";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the consideration of real driving emissions, the reduction in NO_ x emissions in high transient engine operation becomes even more challenging. Apart from increasing the complexity of exhaust aftertreatment systems, internal engine measures play a major role. The approach to reducing NO_ x emissions described in this paper uses the precise control of the combustion. For this purpose, the method of digital combustion rate shaping control is applied, which allows the realization of a predefined combustion by automatically adapting the injection profile during operation. Within this work, this controller is extended in order to control the predefined combustion trace based on target NO_ x values. First, the working principal of the state-of-the-art digital combusting rate shaping controller is explained. In the next step, the design and strategy of the extended control approach are explained and validated. Finally, its potential to reduce engine-out NO_ x emissions during transient driving situations is evaluated based on simulations of the WLTC. It is shown that the control concept fulfills the requirements and is able to effectively reduce high NO_ x peaks during transient operation.;"Diesel engine; Emission control; Combustion rate shaping; Closed loop combustion control; NO Control";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this article, we provide a taxonomy of the challenges in the current IoT infrastructure, and a literature survey with a taxonomy of the issues to expect in the future of the IoT after adopting blockchain as an infrastructure. The two architectures are compared based on their strengths and weaknesses. Then a brief survey of ongoing key research activities in blockchain is presented, which will have considerable impact on overcoming the challenges encountered in the applicability of blockchain in IoT.

To solve this problem, a novel flexible overhead-line high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission converter station topology is proposed in this study, which provides DC fault blocking capability. By adding blocking submodules (SMs) onto the positive and negative DC buses of a conventional HBSM converter station, a rapid fault current blocking can be achieved in the case of a DC bus short circuit. The DC fault blocking principle of the proposed topology and the rapid fault blocking capability of the blocking SM are analyzed. The quantity of required major components is also calculated. In addition, the IGBT, the system loss and the control complexity quantities are comprehensively compared with those of existing topologies.

Calibration workflows involve a number of parties such as device users, manufacturers, calibration facilities and NMIs who must collaborate but may also compete (mutually untrusting). For instance, a surgical robot manufacturer may wish to hide the identities of third-parties from the operator (hospital), in order to maintain confidentiality of business relationships around its robot products. Thus, information flows that reveal who-calibrates-for-whom need to be managed to ensure confidentiality. Similarly, meta-information about what-is-being-calibrated and how-often-it-is-calibrated may compromise operational confidentiality of a deployment. We show that the challenge of managing information flows between the parties involved in calibration cannot be met by any of the classical access control models, as any one of them, or a simple conjunction of a subset such as the lattice model, fails to meet the desired access control requirements. We demonstrate that a new unified access control model that combines BIBA, BLP, and Chinese Walls holds rich promise. We study the case for unification, system properties, and develop an XACML-based authorisation framework which enforces the unified model. We show that upon evaluation against a baseline simple-conjunction of the three models individually, our unified model outperforms with authorisation times at least 10ms lower than the baseline. This demonstrates it is capable of solving the novel access control challenges thrown up by digital-calibration workflows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this work, we propose a solution for secure management of IoT devices that participate in the blockchain with their own blockchain accounts (BCAs) so that the IoT devices themselves can sign transactions. Any blockchain participant (including IoT devices) can obtain and verify information not only about the actions or data they are taking but also about their manufacturers, managers (owners and approved), and users. Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) based on the ERC-721 standard are proposed to manage IoT devices as unique and indivisible. The BCA of an IoT device, which is defined as an NFT attribute, is associated with the physical device since the secret seed from which the BCA is generated is not stored anywhere but a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) inside the hardware of the device reconstructs it. The proposed solution is demonstrated and evaluated with a low-cost IoT device based on a Pycom Wipy 3.0 board, which uses the internal SRAM of the microcontroller ESP-32 as PUF. The operations it performs to reconstruct its BCA in Ethereum and to carry out transactions take a few tens of milliseconds.

In addition, DP largely depends on defect detection either found earlier in the design and implementation stages or held in the testing phases. However, testing maturity model integration (TMMI) has a crucial aspect in DP as well as process improvement of the software. In particular, when software gets validated by being tested and fixed the defects up, it achieves the maximum capability maturity model integration (CMMI) aiming the process improvement. Here, the article has proposed an improved defect detection and prevention model to enhance the software process following the approach of XP. Besides, as a unique contribution, we have united the capability and testing model integration to ensure better SPI.;"SPI; CMMI; TMMI; Agile; Defect prevention; Extreme programming";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

At its core is the need to connect physical devices with their digital representations which essentially means establishing a digital twin. Currently, the technological development of digital twins has gathered much attention while the organizational and business aspects are less investigated. In response, the suitability of enterprise modeling and capability management for the purpose of developing and management of business-driven digital twins has been analyzed. A number of requirements from literature are summarized and two industrial cases have been analyzed for the purpose of investigating how the digital twin initiatives emerge and what forces drive the start of their implementation projects. The findings are discussed with respect to how Enterprise Modeling and the Capability-Driven Development method are able to support the business motivation, design and runtime management of digital twins.;"Capability management; Digital twins; Digital transformation";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For this reason, there is a need to support the maintenance and revitalization of these languages as part of the reconciliation process. However, there has been little research to guide the use of technology in supporting language revitalization. To contribute to this process, this study investigated the use of a novel e-learning activity for a specific Indigenous language - Plains Cree (nehiyawewin). This activity, SoundHunters, targets the development of learner phonological awareness (i.e., their ability to understand and manipulate sounds in a language) through game play. A mixed-methods study was used to measure learning and explore learner experiences. Learner performance on a transcription task, which required the mapping of sounds to characters, improved following SoundHunters use. The nature of learner errors indicates the development of learners’ interlanguage and provides evidence of transfer from English to Cree. Additionally, learners enjoyed the activity while finding it appropriately challenging. These results show the potential for using adaptive technology to support learning in low-resource settings, such as those that exist for most Indigenous languages.;"Computer assisted language learning; Indigenous languages; Listening skills";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the spread of AR applications in various domains (e.g. product design, manufacturing or maintenance) and the introduction of concepts such as Pervasive Augmented Reality (PAR), the aspect context-awareness started to play an important role. By sensing the user’s current context and adapting the AR application accordingly, an adequate user experience can be achieved. Due to the complex structure and composition of AR applications, their development is a challenging task. Although, context-awareness for AR systems was addressed to some extent, a systematic method for development of context-aware AR applications is not fully covered yet. Therefore, in this paper, we identify the main challenges for development of context-aware AR applications and sketch our solution idea for a model-based development framework. The benefit and applicability of our solution idea is shown on the basis of two example mobile AR applications supporting context-awareness.;"Augmented reality; Context-awareness; Model-based development";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For example, product design processes, manufacturing processes, and maintenance processes across different factories and enterprises. This complex and competitive collaboration requires the underlying system architecture and platform to be flexible and extensible to support the demands of dynamic collaborations as well as advanced functionalities such as big data analytics. Both operation and condition of the production equipment are critical to the whole manufacturing process. Failures of any machine tools can easily have impact on the subsequent value-added processes of the collaboration. Predictive maintenance provides a detailed examination of the detection, location and diagnosis of faults in related machineries using various analyses. In this context, this paper explores how the FIWARE framework supports predictive maintenance. Specifically, it looks at applying a data driven approach to the Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) model for machine condition and remaining useful life to support predictive maintenance using FIWARE framework in a modular fashion.;"Predictive maintenance; FIWARE; LSTM; Big data analytics; Industry 4.0";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Most of the quality improvement strategies in software development focusses on optimizing a single response variable such as the defect count. But in reality, many responses contribute to the quality of software developed which requires to be studied simultaneously. This paper attempts to study the number of defects in software and the effort required in correcting these defects, simultaneously using desirability function and Taguchi method. Effort is defined as the time span from when the defect was logged into the system to the time when the defect was corrected and removed from the system and is measured in hours. The work has been executed on the issue tracking system of a large telecommunication organization. The organization manufactured consumer electronic devices having embedded software developed using agile development method. The input factors studied are Change Request Priority, software development phase and severity, which were selected from a total of 24 parameters using analytic hierarchy process. Significant factors and their optimal levels which optimized the defects captured and the effort taken to eliminate them, were obtained. Confirmation tests were performed using the optimal settings of the input factors on the data from the subsequent sprint which showed a 20% improvement in the overall desirability value.;"Desirability function; Taguchi method; Agile software development; CR Priority; Software development phase; Severity; Effort; Defects";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These new kinds of automation systems allow more product variations, smaller life cycles, smaller batch sizes and pave the way from mass production to mass customization. This is due to completely new breed of safe robot technology but also novel ways of setting up new applications like e.g. kinesthetic programming. However, the topic of reducing the programming effort for complex tasks using natural modes of communication is still open. This paper addresses the key developments in this field, shows different ways of programming, and gives relevant use cases in industrial assembly. The technology coverage starts with an online workflow editor called XROB that allows easy-to-use setup of process workflows and related skill parameters. However, in order to reduce the programming effort, a novel way to demonstrate process trajectories by using instrumented hand guided process tools is presented. Finally, the paper gives an overview of a promising approach that allows programming without touching the robot just by demonstrating the process by an expert. The semantic relations between activities executed by the human and robot skills are captured to learn the task sequence of the assembly process. The acquired process knowledge is refined to execute robotic tasks with the help of an interactive graphical user interface (GUI). The system queries the user for feedback, asking for specific information to help the robot complete the task at hand. The given examples show the usability of flexible programming tools in the automation chain and the presented results provide strong evidence of the technological potential in the field. Die produzierende Industrie erfährt einen Paradigmenwechsel, da Roboter ihr typisches Anwendungsfeld verlassen und in Bereiche vordringen, die von der robotergestützten Automatisierung bisher unberührt geblieben sind. Diese neuartigen Automatisierungssysteme ermöglichen mehr Produktvariationen, kleinere Lebenszyklen und kleinere Losgrößen und ebnen den Weg von der Massenproduktion zur Produktindividualität. Dies ist auf eine völlig neue Art sicherer Robotertechnologie zurückzuführen, aber auch auf neue Wege zur Realisierung neuer Anwendungen wie z.B. der kinästhetischen Programmierung. Ein weiterhin offenes Thema ist den Programmieraufwand für komplexe Aufgaben mit natürlichen Kommunikationswegen zu reduzieren. Diese Publikation befasst sich mit den wichtigsten Entwicklungen in diesem Bereich, zeigt verschiedene Möglichkeiten der Programmierung auf und beschreibt relevante Anwendungsfälle in der industriellen Montage. Das betrachtete Technologieportfolio beinhaltet einen Online-Workflow-Editor namens XRob, welcher die einfache Einrichtung von Prozessabläufen und damit verbundenen Qualifikationsparametern ermöglicht. Um den Programmieraufwand zu reduzieren, wird eine neuartige Möglichkeit zur Demonstration von Prozessverläufen, unter Verwendung von instrumentierten, handgeführten Prozesswerkzeugen, vorgestellt. Schließlich gibt das Paper einen Überblick über einen vielversprechenden Ansatz, der die Programmierung ohne Berührung des Roboters ermöglicht, nur durch die Demonstration des Prozesses durch einen Experten.

However, the HB relation is sensitive to thread interleaving; thus, hidden races that can be revealed in other thread interleavings may remain despite the repeated running of a program with an HB detector. In this paper, we propose a noise injection-based race detection technique (RaceInducer) that can expose and detect hidden races by using the runtime HB analysis result to determine the noise injection instants. RaceInducer delays a thread execution after the occurrence of the first no-lock non-racing accesses of three types (read-exclusive, write-exclusive, and read-shared) to a shared variable during a precise HB detection (FastTrack). Using this technique, RaceInducer can efficiently disturb the normal locking sequences between two threads that generate HB edges hiding data races. We implemented RaceInducer on the RoadRunner instrumentation framework for Java and evaluated its detection capability and runtime overheads on 12 real-world benchmark programs. The evaluation results showed that RaceInducer generated a lower runtime overhead compared to random noise injection that randomly injected noise for no-lock non-racing accesses and can detect more races with the same noise strength. RaceInducer generates particularly lower runtime overhead than the random noise injection for large programs that generates a high number of shared-memory accesses. In addition, we experimentally demonstrated that RaceInducer incurred lower runtime overheads than a current hidden-race detector (DrFinder) for programs with a relatively large number of locking operations.";"Data race; Happens-before relation; Noise injection; Dynamic detection";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
230;The layout design in reconfigurable manufacturing systems: a literature review;10.1007/s00170-019-04190-3;Springer;"Maganha, Isabela; Silva, Cristovao; Ferreira, Luis Miguel D. F.";The layout design in reconfigurable manufacturing systems: a literature review;2019;The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology;The layout is an important issue in the design of manufacturing systems. In conventional systems, the layout rarely changes after the initial design. However, as the market demands are changing more frequently, layout configurations must be capable of reconfiguring the arrangement of resources to suit new production requirements, while minimising material handling and relocation costs and maximising savings in material flow and inventory costs. This paper presents a literature review on the layout design of reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS), focusing on reconfigurable layouts, which have been attracting increasing attention in recent years. A systematic literature network analysis was applied to identify trends, evolutionary trajectories and key issues that are influencing the development of knowledge in this field of study. The results are analysed and discussed using a bibliometric and a chronological citation network analysis. The major findings of this research includes (1) the layout design of RMS must be integrated in the process of RMS design, which, in turn, should be considered as a cyclic process, instead of divided into phases. (2) The core characteristics of reconfigurability and the layout design cannot be dissociated. (3) Operational performance measures are rarely considered in the reconfigurable layout problem, despite their importance. (4) Optimisation approaches have been widely used to solve the reconfigurable layout problem. However, they might not be the most suitable approach to deal with the uncertainty and variability present in manufacturing environments in which reconfigurable layouts are required. Finally, this paper identifies gaps in the literature and suggests directions for future research.;"Reconfigurable manufacturing system; Layout design; Choice of machines; Layout problem; Systematic literature network analysis";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Hence, any interruption in electric power is likely to have an undesirable impact on the overall operation of any residential or commercial ecosystem. The serious impacts of power supply interruption attacks have been realized in the recent cyber incidents such as the Ukraine power blackout. It is also evident from recent incidents that both network and process vulnerabilities are crucial for an adversary to cause an adverse impact on the operation. This paper reports an investigation into power supply interruption and malicious power generation attacks focusing on process and network vulnerabilities. The investigation was conducted in two steps: First, a vulnerability assessment was conducted on a fully operational electric power testbed. Next, the vulnerabilities discovered were exploited to perform different types of power supply interruption attacks and malicious power generation attacks. The attacks were executed using control code modification and SMA, a PV converter manufacturer, portal manipulation. The attacks reported here are useful for researchers and smart-grid operators to design and develop effective protection, detection, and response mechanisms.;"Critical infrastructure; Cyber-physical systems; Smart-grid security; Industrial control system; Cyber-attacks; SCADA security; Power interruption attacks; Malicious power generation";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this constrained nonlinear mixed-integer problem, both the number of redundant components and their reliability in each subsystem are to be decided simultaneously so as to maximize the reliability of the system. The proposed ASPSO operates with a new updating model to adjust the position of particles, without dealing with velocity. In addition, a randomization technique, based on the dispersion of particle bests through the search space, is used to speed up the convergence of the proposed approach and prevent it from being trapped within the local optimum. Moreover, to control the balance between exploration and exploitation, during the search process, two adaptive functions are utilized. The simulation results of four different benchmarks for the reliability–redundancy allocation problem are reported and compared. Accordingly, the solutions given by the new presented approach are all superior to those best known solutions provided by several methods in the literature.;"Reliability optimization; Redundancy allocation; Particle swarm optimization; Particles dispersion; Adaptive function";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The welfare of the king lies not in what he desires, but what his subjects desire) to Mahatma Gandhi [Mahatma Gandhi propounded the concept of “Su-raj” and according to him “good governance” has the following eight attributes, which link it to its citizens: (1) accountable, (2) transparent, (3) responsive, (4) equitable and inclusive, (5) effective and efficient, (6) follows the rule of law, (7) participatory and (8) consensus oriented] in recent times. However, achieving good governance in a country of size of India is hard. Good governance needs to address social, cultural, ethical and process dimensions. Governance not only needs to be good and efficient, but needs to human-centric. At times even well-intentioned and well-thought out processes of Government cause lot of trauma to common citizens. On the contrary doing away with safeguards is inviting disaster. To meet the objective of human-centric good governance, we have developed Tantra social information management framework. Tantra framework makes use of concepts from Zachman framework and unified foundational ontology. The framework itself is modeled as a social network (entity–entity network). Tantra framework interoperates with models such as balanced score card, theory of change and Bartels’ theory of separations.

Human cognition has been researched in many domains. Numerous theories such as utility theory, three-level situation awareness and theory of dual cognition suggest how human cognition behaves. These theories present the varieties of human cognition including deliberate and naturalistic thinking. However, studies have not taken into consideration varieties of human cognition employed when responding to abnormal machine behaviour. This study reviews theories of cognition, along with empirical work on the significance of human cognition, including several case studies. The different propositions of human cognition concerning abnormal machine behaviour are compared to dual cognition theories. Our results show that situation awareness is a suitable framework to model human cognition of abnormal machine behaviour. We also propose a continuum which represents varieties of cognition, lying between explicit and implicit cognition.

Production Management for the Factory of the Future;In order to be successful in the market in the long term, enterprises must not only continuously optimize their operations but also constantly innovate. It is necessary to develop radically new digital services which disrupt their existing business model. For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it is a major challenge to put the generated solutions into practice. They have to cope with digitalization while having limited resources. The presented paper starts by examining the challenges for SMEs in the context of digitalization. Thus, an analysis of the approaches used in practice for implementing digital services in 36 SMEs is carried out. Essential differences between start-ups and established SMEs are identified. On this basis, a capability-based, agile methodology is presented which supports enterprises in advancing newly developed, digital services from prototype status to the customer’s environment. Finally, the methodology is put into practical application within an innovation project in an SME.;"Service development; Innovation; Capability-based; Digitalization";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Meanwhile, cloud-based security solutions are available, but they use too much memory and CPU to be deployed in low-cost hardware typically used for IoT gateways such as the Raspberry Pi. In our work, we identified critical requirements for a generic security framework that could be deployed to low-cost hardware used for IoT gateways. From this point on, we implemented the security framework, and modified a Content Management System (CMS) to rely on the framework for authentication and policy evaluations. We evaluated our component’s runtime performance and computational resource consumption in comparison to a popular attribute-based security framework written in Java. We measured the CPU, memory, and network usage for each security framework, their databases, and the CMS across three different hardware platforms. To ensure our results are not biased towards a particular hardware set-up, we chose hardware with two different processor architectures, different capabilities and vendors. Our results indicate that our framework not only requires less time to complete requests but also makes less intensive use of the processor and the memory, i.e., the most critical capabilities for IoT gateways today.";"Access control; IoT gateway; Identity management";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the FA is easy to fall into local optimum, and the solution accuracy of the FA is lower. In order to overcome these problems. An improved Firefly algorithm hybrid with Fireworks (FWFA) is proposed in this paper. Because the local search ability of the fireworks algorithm’s search strategy is strong, we introduce the fireworks algorithm neighborhood search operator of the fireworks algorithm into the firefly algorithm to improve the local search ability of the Firefly algorithm. Through the simulation and analysis of 28 benchmark functions, verify the effectiveness and reliability of the new algorithm. The experimental results show that the new algorithm has excellent search ability in solving unimodal functions and multimodal functions.;"Swarm intelligence; Firefly algorithm (FA); Domain search; Fireworks algorithm (FWA); Hybrid algorithm";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Conversely, since the beginning of the 21^st century engineering projects are designed from a computer (i.e., in a virtual environment) by defining scenarios and functional configurations that can be tested using human-in-the-loop simulations where the issue of tangibility is becoming crucial along three dimensions: technology, organizations and people (jobs). These virtual structures and functions must be made tangible from two points of view: that of physics and that of the figurative (i.e., cognitive and socio-cognitive). Tangibility can be characterized and evaluated through five dimensions: complexity; maturity; flexibility; stability; and sustainability. It is interesting to note that these dimensions can be mirrored with that of autonomy: inter-connectivity, independence, flexibility, resilience, and persistence. In this perspective, this article presents a new paradigm, the Human-Systems Integration (HSI) and analyzes the evolution of rigid automation towards a flexible autonomy, proposing a new paradigm of HCD.";"Human-Centered Design; Flexibility; Tangibility";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The QSS system is among the simplest sampling systems that involves a normal plan and a tightened plan under switching rules. The operating characteristic function of the proposed system is derived from an exact sampling distribution. The plan parameters are determined by a mathematical model that ensures the prescribed quality and risk requirements. The performance and behavior of the proposed variables QSS system are discussed and compared with those of conventional plans. For practical purposes, this article provides tables of the plan parameters under various conditions, and illustrates the method on an example taken from the integrated circuit industry.;"Process capability indices; Acceptance sampling; Quality control; Quality assurance; Process yield; Switching rule";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Machines can be more than either fully automated or manually controlled, but can work together with the human on different levels of assistance and automation in a hopefully beneficial cooperation. One way of cooperation is that the automation and the human have a shared control over a situation, e.g., a vehicle in an environment. Another way of cooperation is that they trade control. Cooperation can include shared and traded control. The objective of this paper is to give an overview on the development towards a common meta-model of shared and cooperative assistance and automation. The meta-models based on insight from the h(orse)–metaphor and Human–Machine Cooperation principles are presented and combined to propose a framework and criteria to design safe, efficient, ecological, and attractive systems. Cooperation is presented from different points of view such as levels of activity (operational, tactical and strategic levels) as well as the type of function shared between human and machine (information gathering, information analysis, decision selection, and action implementation). Examples will be provided in the aviation domain, in the automotive domain with the automation of driving, as well as in robotics and in manufacturing systems highlighting the usefulness of new automated function but also the increase of systems complexity.;"Human–machine systems; Human-centered design; Balanced systems; Multi-level systems; Shared control; Cooperative control; Cooperation";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, little research has been done on its improvisation mechanism. This paper offers a detailed discussion on the HS improvisation mechanism, which aims to state that the improvisation is a generic search framework. To improve the performance of HS, global learning strategy is designed to enhance the global search capability, and modified random selection is used to reduce the possibility of falling into local optimum. Moreover, a new improvement perspective such as the adjustment of iteration model is presented in this paper. Different iteration models such as dimension-to-dimension mode, stochastic multi-dimensional mode, vector mode and matrix mode to explore the optimization potential of HS algorithm are employed. Combining the improved operations, parameter adjustments and the four iteration models, four improved HS variants are proposed to analyze the effectiveness of iteration model on HS algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed HS algorithms can yield significant improved performance. Overall, the paper shows that the HS improvisation framework has a good extensibility and the iteration model has significant impact on the performance of HS.;"Harmony search algorithm; Improvisation mechanism; Global learning; Iteration model; Extensibility";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In order to solve this problem, an integrated three-dimensional (3D) elastic-plastic finite element model (FEM) of rolls and strip is built to calculate the effect functions in consideration of work roll bending (WRB), intermediate roll bending (IMRB), and CVC intermediate roll shifting (IMRS) with different strip widths. A set of orthogonal vectors which is defined as eigenvectors is proposed to analyze the similarities and the complementarities of the effect functions. It is applied to study the flatness control characteristics of the cold rolling mill. Based on the analysis of flatness stress characteristics of different strip widths in the production, it is found that the similarities between the flatness stress and the eigenvectors of different strip widths are relative low. The flatness defects are difficult to be eliminated. From the relationship between IMRS and strip widths, a segmented CVC intermediate roll contour is then proposed and experimented in an industrial production. The proportion of coupled edge and center waves is decreased by 15.2%, and the overall flatness is reduced by 0.7 IU.;"6-h CVC cold rolling mill; Effect function; 3D FEM; Flatness control; Roll contour";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

N.; Agrawal, Rajeev";Optimal sequence planning for multi-model reconfigurable assembly systems;2019;The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology;In this paper, a tri-objective optimization problem related to sequencing in multi-model reconfigurable assembly systems (RAS) is addressed. RASs are also designed around product families similar to the more generic reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs). A multi-model assembly line needs reconfiguration after assembling each batch of the products from the family. Further, the changeover of assembly line from one product type to another is also of varying degree of complexity and reconfiguration cost. Two novel indices for commonality and reconfiguration complexity are proposed here to incorporate this feature of RAS. Optimizing the reconfiguration time/cost is taken as the first objective while fulfilling the product due dates and the work load balance among the assembly stations as the second and third objective functions, respectively. This optimization problem is solved using a Multi-objective Self-Organizing Migrating Algorithm (MOSOMA) metaheuristic to find the non-dominated Pareto optimal solutions representing optimum sequencing of products in the family. An approach for identifying the best solution from the multiple Pareto optimal solutions using aggregate fitness is also proposed. A numerical illustration along with computational procedure is presented on a hypothetical RAS model.;"Reconfigurable manufacturing systems; Reconfigurable assembly systems; Multi-objective optimization; Multi-objective self-organizing migrating algorithm (MOSOMA); Pareto optimization";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Willingness to communicate (WTC) in a second language is believed to have a direct and sustained influence on learners’ actual usage frequency of the target language. To help overcome the lack of suitable environments for increasing L2 learners’ WTC, our approach is to build embodied conversational agents that can help learners surmount their apprehension towards communication in L2. Here, we focus on the dialogue management aspects of our approach and propose a model based on a set of communication strategies (CS) and affective backchannels (AB) to foster such agents’ ability to carry on natural and WTC-friendly conversations with learners. We examined learners’ expected WTC after interacting with one of the following versions of the system: an agent featuring both CS and AB; an agent featuring only CS; and an agent featuring only AB. The results suggested that combining CS and AB empowers the conversational agent and leads to higher expected WTC among L2 learners. We also found that even the AB-only version of the system had the potential to enhance WTC to some extent. These findings are evidence of the feasibility of enhancing L2 learners’ engagement towards communication using a computer-based environment coupled with appropriate conversational strategies.";"Willingness to communicate in L2; Embodied conversational agents; Communication strategies; Affective backchannels";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is of great significance to explore the key management indicators of emergency supply chain for its management and efficient operation. In order to reveal the essence of emergency supply chain management, production, procurement, distribution, storage, use, recycling and other emergencies, supply chain links are considered to establish an emergency supply chain management index system to identify the key influencing factors in the emergency supply chain. The emergency supply chain involves many management elements and the traditional qualitative analysis and comprehensive evaluation methods have their shortcomings in practice. In order to get a more suitable method, a novel evaluation model is proposed, based on Rough set–house of quality method. In this paper, Rough set is used to filter the indexes, eliminate redundant indicators, and simplify many management indicators of the emergency supply chain system to a few core indicators. Then, the house of quality is used to analyze and sort the core index to get the key management index of emergency supply chain. The effectiveness of the proposed evaluation model is validated through a series of numerical experiments. The experimental results also show that the proposed evaluation model can assist decision makers in optimizing the emergency supply chain procedure and improving the efficiency of accident rescue.;"Emergency supply chain; Rough set; House of quality; management indicators; attribute reduction";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Recent attacks have shown that not only are many IoT devices at risk of exploit, but those devices can be successfully used to attack wider systems and cause economic damage. Currently, most devices connect to a cloud service that is provided by the manufacturer of the device, offering no choice to move to more secure systems. We outline a proposed model for IoT that allows the identity of users and devices to be federated. Users and devices are issued with secure, random, anonymised identities that are not shared with third parties. We demonstrate how devices can be connected to third-party applications without inherently de-anonymising them. Sensor data and actuator commands are federated through APIs to cloud services. All access to device data and commands is based on explicit consent from users. Each user’s data is handled by a personal cloud instance providing improved security and isolation, as well as providing a trusted intermediary for both devices and cloud services. We demonstrate this model is workable with a prototype system that implements the major features of the model.

The role of IT has gone beyond computing. The capability of Information management is critical to the organizational strategy. At the same time, the finance function is undergoing massive transformation, with the IT function building systems and solutions for the new environment. Budget, as one of the key management tool of the finance function, has been pushed by digitalization to provide real time information and enhance decision making and value to the business. Based on a case study, the authors discuss the integration of the IT system with the budgetary control system in support of the strategy of the company, and a dynamic model of the process was built. The underlying mechanism linking IT to strategy is also discussed. In this way, the authors prove that when properly integrated with budget of the finance function, IT can move from computation technology to become capabilities that create value for business.;"Digital economic; IT system; Budgetary control system; Strategic management; Integration";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As language learning relies on situated, grounded and social learning, in which interaction and repeated practice are central, social robots hold promise as educational tools for supporting second language learning. This paper surveys the developmental psychology of second language learning and suggests an agenda to study how core concepts of second language learning can be taught by a social robot.

Besides the process of defining and documenting the necessary evidence to comply with process standard requirements is often manual, time consuming and laborious. In earlier studies, we developed a translation scheme and metamodel for consistent and uniform software process formalisation. In the current study, we leverage the formal process specification to develop a two-step formal process verification approach; first we extract process requirements from the standard documents and translate them into logical axioms.

Ongoing Research and Development;Successful realization of projects in dispersed, multinational teams is a difficult task, because of the communication and collaboration issues which may arise due to scarce personal contact, linguistic problems or less influential leadership. In such an environment, it is particularly important to assist the management of project communication processes with appropriate ICT tools. However, due to the huge number of software products aimed at supporting these processes which are available on the market, it is a challenge to choose the best one for a given project and team. In this paper, a four-stage procedure based on the weighted regularized Hasse matrix is proposed as a way of solving the problem of selecting the most suitable project communication management software for a project having specific requirements. The proposed procedure involves comparing and ranking candidate tools taking into consideration the importance of multiple functional and non-functional features of the project communication management systems with their respective weights based on the results of a questionnaire conducted among members of a dispersed international project team. As illustrated by the provided example, the proposed procedure effectively leads to a complete ranking of candidate tools without the necessity to perform effort-demanding pairwise comparisons of alternatives or complicated calculations required by other methods (such as AHP or outranking methods). For this reason, the presented findings have vast implications for practice, introducing a convenient way of solving the project communication management software selection problem in the case of many candidate solutions and multiple criteria having distinct weights.;"Software selection; Weighted regularized Hasse method; Project communication management support";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, their age-related perceptual and cognitive declines lead them to change their driving habits as a way of compensating their limitations and difficulties in driving. Being older drivers particularly vulnerable, it is considered that in-vehicle technologies represent a potential to increase safety and possibly save lives. Automation in the road transport system is coming faster than expected but most of the potential users have unrealistic representations of autonomous vehicles, the driver’s role in automation or the impacts of automation on the road transport system. Thus, the adoption of partial or full automation to help older drivers in the performance of the driving task is still requiring in-depth research, as well as the design and application of appropriate training programs.;"Older drivers; Self-regulation; In-vehicle technologies; Human-centered design; Driving automation; Function allocation; Human-automation interaction; Older drivers’ training";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In particular, one aspect that stands out is the disorder that presents inside the company when managing multiple projects with a very small human team. This paper seeks to identify experiences of application of models related to portfolio management in small contexts in the software industry. The study is carried out through a systematic literature review in relevant digital repositories. We have found 60 primary studies obtained in the search in the considered databases. Primary studies show that project portfolio management models present difficulties in their adoption in small contexts. In addition, there are few studies that refer to experiences of application of portfolio management models in small context in the software industry and point out that a relevant aspect for non-adoption is the lack of understanding of the models in their original proposal.;"Project portfolio management; project management; software development; small entity";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper proposes a taxonomy of alternative process quality characteristics based on intrinsic and extrinsic quality attributes. The ultimate goal of this taxonomy is to provide a framework to conduct process assessments using different process quality aspects. Such a framework would considerably broaden process quality perspectives beyond the primary measure of process capability. It would also allow practitioners to identify and evaluate relevant quality characteristics for processes based on specific contexts and implications.

These information systems allocate resources to perform activities based on information that describes those resources and activities. It is widely recognized that resource allocation can be enhanced by considering resource characteristics during selection. However, little guidance is available that shows how such characteristics should be specified. Human ability is one such characteristic, with the advantage that it is well-defined in the Fleishman Taxonomy of Human Abilities. This paper presents a method that leverages the Fleishman taxonomy to specify activities and human resources. Those specifications are then used to allocate resources to activities during process run-time.

These processes are rather common for dealing with multiple quality characteristics. To evaluate the process ability and meet customer needs, multivariate statistical techniques are recommended for estimating the capability indices. Principal component analysis can be applied to reducing the problem dimension and estimate process capability indices. The aim of this study was to assess the capability of AISI 52100 hardened steel turning operations and achieve process specifications. Multivariate process capability indices were calculated to assess five roughness parameters of surface finishing. By using a weighted approach of principal component analysis, a new method is proposed for estimating the process capability indices. The results highlight not only the relevance of conducting a multivariate capability analysis in the case of actual machining but also how successfully the proposed method was performed.;"Process capability index; Hard turning; Roughness; Principal component analysis";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
280;Identification of key design characteristics for complex product adaptive design;10.1007/s00170-017-1267-0;Springer;"Han, Xin; Li, Rong; Wang, Jian; Qin, Shengfeng; Ding, Guofu";Identification of key design characteristics for complex product adaptive design;2018;The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology;Key design characteristics (KDCs) are important information related to the product and part designs, which significantly influence on the product’s functions, performances, and quality. Identifying KDCs for a complex product will help designers to focus on key design parameters during the design process and rapidly obtain design schemes based on their close relationships to the product’s functions, performances, and quality. Although there are some researches on key characteristic (KC) identification, most of them are focused on key process characteristics (KPCs) and few on KDCs. There also lacks a KDC identification framework to support KDC identification with better completeness and diverse usages. Adaptive design is the most important pattern of complex product design. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic method to identify KDCs for complex product adaptive design, in which KDCs can be determined by two related phases. Firstly, a product design specification (PDS)-KDC Candidates Network (PKCN) is constructed by using existing product instance data, cluster analysis, KC flow-down, and network analysis approaches. Then, the result from the first phase is used as a basis to identify KDCs for adaptive design. Three KDC identification techniques: similarity reasoning technique, breadth-first search (BFS), and the gray relational analysis approach are applied to find out KDCs from the PKCN, which are the most sensitive to the variation of a PDS. These identified KDCs can help designers to understand the relationships between KDCs and PDS and rapidly develop a design scheme. The effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed method are verified by a case study via the development of an electric multiple unit (EMU)’s bogie.;"Identification of key design characteristics; Systematic approach; Complex products; Adaptive design; Network analysis; Gray relational analysis";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To build such complex systems, instead of writing the code from scratch, one can follow the model-driven development approach, which aims to generate software from design models automatically. To achieve this goal, two important prerequisites are: a domain-specific modeling language for designing an emergency response environment model, and transformation programs for automatic code generation from a model. In addition, for modeling with the language, a modeling tool is required, and for executing the generated code there is a need to a platform. In this paper, a model-driven framework for developing multi-agent systems in emergency response environments is provided which includes several items. A domain-specific modeling language as well as a modeling tool is developed for this domain. The language and the tool are called ERE-ML and ERE-ML Tool, respectively. Using the ERE-ML Tool, a designer can model an emergency response situation and then validate the model against the predefined constraints. Furthermore, several model to code transformations are defined for automatic multi-agent system code generation from an emergency response environment model. For executing the generated code, an extension of JAMDER platform is also provided. To evaluate our framework, several case studies including the Victorian bushfire disaster are modeled to show the ability of the framework in modeling real-world situations and automatic transformation of the model into the code.;"Domain-specific modeling language; Emergency response environment; Multi-agent system; Model-driven development; ERE-ML; Model to code transformation";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we present a methodology and validation procedure for creating expert model representations in the domain of rifle marksmanship. GIFT (Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring) was used as the architecture to guide development efforts and was paired with an Army marksmanship simulator that collects behavioral information through sensor technologies. The models were based on expert data from eight members of the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit’s Service Rifle Team. The goal is to establish validated models that serve as artificial intelligence assessment criteria for driving a self-regulated training environment. We review the techniques applied to the data for model construction, the trends found in the data that are generalized across each expert informed through cross-fold validation practices, and discuss how the models will be used for driving real-time assessment.

Many optimal parking trajectories and control strategies have been proposed for reverse parking. However, most of these require intensive computation, causing difficulties in practical use. This paper makes use of a classical path planning method to find the shortest parking path, and establishes the possibility of integrating iterative learning control (ILC) to exploit the capability of learning from experience to track the designed path. The effectiveness of the ILC structure is demonstrated by simulation and experiments. Tracking performance is shown to be much improved by using a simple learning control law.;"Parallel parking; Dubin’s path; Iterative learning control; Steering control";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To achieve this aim, innovative teaching methods are often deployed, including games and simulations, which form the subject of this paper. As the field of digital games and simulations is ever maturing, this paper attempts to systematically review the literature relevant to games and simulation pedagogy in higher education. Two researchers collaborate to apply a qualitative method, coding and synthesizing the results using multiple criteria. The main objective is to study the impact of games and simulations with regard to achieving specific learning objectives. On balance, results indicate that games and/or simulations have a positive impact on learning goals. The researchers identify three learning outcomes when integrating games into the learning process: cognitive, behavioural, and affective. As a final step, the authors consolidate evidence for the benefit of academics and practitioners in higher education interested in the efficient use of games and simulations for pedagogical purposes. Such evidence also provides potential options and pathways for future research.;"Game-based learning; Digital games; Simulations; Pedagogical use; Higher education; Learning outcomes; Cognitive goals; Behavioural goals; Affective goals";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

During the micro cutting process, the manufactured components and characteristics usually belong to mesoscale, and the final geometric accuracy and surface quality are affected by many factors. In this paper, a series of micro milling tests based on heat-resistant stainless steel (12Cr18Ni9) are carried out to figure out the influence of different factors on machining quality of mesoscale low-rigidity characteristics. During the study, the small displacement torsors (SDT) theory are employed to characterize the perpendicularity tolerance of mesoscale surface. Optical microscopic measurement method is used to obtain SDT parameters, then the width of the tolerance zone is obtained; based on which, the effect of different factors on machining quality is systematically studied. In addition, the surface roughness and micro topography of the machined surface are also analyzed, and the phenomenon of surface deterioration caused by high-temperature chip is effectively controlled.

For the multivariate analysis, we applied cluster analysis and factor analysis. Through the former, we conclude that dynamic capacities concentrate on five approaches: Digital Capabilities, Knowledge Capabilities, Absorptive Capabilities, Strategic Capabilities and Resources. As regards factor analysis, this returns five factors with two of them concentrated into the same approach: Resources and Capabilities. We would also state that the Strategic Capabilities approach spans across the remaining three factors and does not constitute a single factor.;"Dynamic Capabilities; Resources and capabilities based view; Strategic management";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The objective of the matchmaking is to discover and select the most appropriate Web service among the different available candidates. Different matchmaking frameworks are now available in the literature but most of them present at least one of the following shortcomings: (i) use of strict syntactic matching; (ii) use of capability-based matching; (iii) lack of customization support; and (iv) lack of accurate ranking of matching Web services. The objective of this paper is thus to present the design, implementation and evaluation of the Parameterized Matching-Ranking Framework (PMRF). The PMRF uses semantic matchmaking, accepts capability and property attributes, supports different levels of customization and generates a ranked list of Web services. Accordingly, it fully overcomes the first, third and fourth shortcomings enumerated earlier and partially addresses the second one. The PMRF is composed of two layers. The role of the first layer is to parse the input data and parameters and then transfer it to the second layer, which represents the matching and ranking engine. The comparison of PMRF to iSeM-logic-based and SPARQLent, using the OWLS-TC4 datasets, shows that the algorithms supported by PMRF outperform those proposed in iSeM-logic-based and SPARQLent.";"Web service; Semantic similarity; Matchmaking; Ranking; Implementation; Performance evaluation";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

IT Governance is an important strategic instrument that should ensure organizations to succeed with this objective and therefore it needs to be efficiently planned, structured and executed. To respond to increasing service demands while preserving or even increasing the value provided by services, public organizations require resources and abilities that lay outside their boundaries - such as co-production, open innovation, as well as engagement of citizens and partner organizations. To respond to these challenges, public organizations need to employ new governance solutions to their IT to overcome the shortcomings of hierarchical structures and traditional centralized decision-making. In this study, we discuss a capability-oriented governance approach, which aligns envisioned public values with actors, processes and resources and accordingly compound different IT Governance capabilities.

A typical VPP is a large industrial plant with high (partially shiftable) electric and thermal loads, renewable energy generators and electric and thermal storages. Optimizing the use and the cost of energy could lead to a significant economic impact. This work proposes a VPP Energy Management System (EMS), based on a two-step optimization model that decides the minimum-cost energy balance at each point in time considering the following data: electrical load, photovoltaic production, electricity costs, upper and lower limits for generating units and storage units. The first (day-ahead) step models the prediction uncertainty using a robust approach defining scenarios to optimize the load demand shift and to estimate the cost. The second step is an online optimization algorithm, implemented within a simulator, that uses the optimal shifts produced by the previous step to minimize, for each timestamp, the real cost while fully covering the optimally shifted energy demand. The system is implemented and tested using real data and we provide analysis of results and comparison between real and estimated optimal costs.;"Virtual Power Plants; Robust optimization; Forecast uncertainty";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Based on a consideration of the reconfiguration of the reconfigurable machine components and manufacturing cells, quantitative models of the key characteristics of an RMS (scalability, convertibility, diagnosability, modularity, integrability, and customization) are established, after which the quantitative models are used as the basis for constructing an RMS evaluation index system. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to assign the weights for these indices. During the evaluation process, PROMETHEE I is first applied to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative scheme. Then, PROMETHEE II is adopted to analyze the net advantages of the schemes. Finally, all of the alternative configurations are ranked according to the analysis results above. The workshop of an institute that has both research and production capabilities was used as an example to validate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method. The example contains 10 alternative reconfiguration schemes, and each scheme consists of six evaluation indices. The computation result shows that quantitative models of six key RMS characteristics are equipped with the ability of quantitative description of the RMS reconfiguration scheme, which gives intuitive decision-making information combined with PROMETHEE, including advantage and disadvantage between alternative schemes, for a decision-maker to select the satisfactory configuration. In addition, only a 7.2 % data loss during the evaluation data processing means the rationality of the selected evaluation index and evaluation algorithm.;"Reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS); RMS characteristics; RMS schemes evaluation; PROMETHEE; AHP";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Software-controlled sensors, actuators and smart objects enable a close coupling of the cyber and physical worlds. Introducing processes into CPS to automate repetitive tasks promises advantages regarding resource utilization and flexibility of control systems for smart spaces. However, process execution systems face new challenges when being adapted for process execution in CPS: the automated processing of sensor events and data, the dynamic invocation of services, the integration of human interaction, and the synchronization of the cyber and physical worlds. Current workflow engines fulfill these requirements only to a certain degree. In this work, we present PROtEUS—an integrated system for process execution in CPS. PROtEUS integrates components for event processing, data routing, dynamic service selection and human interaction on the modeling and execution level. It is the basis for executing self-healing model-based workflows in CPS. We demonstrate the applicability of PROtEUS within two case studies from the Smart Home domain and discuss its feasibility for introducing workflows into cyber-physical systems.;"Process execution; Cyber-physical systems; Workflow system; Internet of things; System architecture; Middleware; Event processing";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Optical navigation systems, such as the one proposed for Orion, require the ability to precisely relate the observed location of an object in a 2D digital image with the true corresponding line-of-sight direction in the camera’s sensor frame. This relationship is governed by the camera’s geometric calibration parameters — typically described by a set of five intrinsic parameters and five lens distortion parameters. While pre-flight estimations of these parameters will exist, environmental conditions often necessitate on-orbit recalibration. This calibration will be performed for Orion using an ensemble of star field images.

303;An interactive variation risk management environment to assess the risk of manufacturing variations;10.1007/s12008-016-0330-7;Springer;"Ibrahim, Ilham H.; Chassapis, Constantin";An interactive variation risk management environment to assess the risk of manufacturing variations;2017;International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing (IJIDeM);Recently, many manufacturing industries have adopted the methods of “Key Characteristics” (KCs) to identify and analyze product and process critical attributes which need extra control on several levels: product, assembly, sub-assembly, part and process to trace manufacturing variations. Manufacturing variations are those unwanted deviations from nominal values which significantly impact product’s quality, performance and cost. However, those manufacturers face some challenges in the implementation of such procedures. This is due to lack of quantitative models to prioritize those (KCs) and quantify their associated risk of variation. Therefore, there is a need for proactive quantitative mechanisms which incorporate knowledge about the current process capability by communicating Process Capability Data (PCD) during the early design stages to reduce design’s sensitivity to manufacturing variations. The present work builds a systematic interactive environment between the design model and the current process capabilities to analyze PCD which processed and stored in designated databases along with proactive mechanisms to capture the impact of manufacturing variations on performance. It prioritizes and quantifies expected future variations due to possible deviations of the design parameters from their nominal values to assess the related risk of variation. This study comes under the broadest risk management procedure to establish for a novel variation risk management methodology works in an interactive design and manufacturing environment. A case study of a connector beam for an edge card has been carried out successfully to prove the effectiveness of the present methodology in quantifying manufacturing variations and assessing their associated risk of variation.;"Manufacturing variations; Knowledge integration; Risk management; Process capability data; Normal distribution";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
304;Variable sampling plan for resubmitted lots based on process capability index and Bayesian approach;10.1007/s00170-016-8958-9;Springer;"Seifi, Sina; Nezhad, Mohammad Saber Fallah";Variable sampling plan for resubmitted lots based on process capability index and Bayesian approach;2017;The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology;"Acceptance sampling plans are applied for quality inspection of products. Among the design approaches of sampling plan, the most important one is to use process capability indices in order to improve the quality of manufacturing processes and the quality inspection of products. But, selection of estimators of process capability index and their sampling distribution is very important. Bayesian statistical technique can be used to obtain the sampling distribution. In this paper, a variable sampling plan is developed for resubmitted lots based on process capability index and Bayesian approach. In the proposed sampling plan, lots are inspected several times depending on the quality level of the process. In addition, this paper presents an optimization model for determining the decision parameters of developed sampling plan with regards to the constraints related to the risk of consumer and producer. Two comparison studied have been done including: First, the methods of double sapling plan (DSP), multiple dependent state (MDS) sampling plan, and repetitive group sampling (RGS) plan are elaborated, and also in order to comparing developed sampling plans, an expected number of products as average sample number (ASN) is used for different developed plans; second, a comparison study between Bayesian approach and exact probability distribution is carried out and their results are analyzed. It is observed that the ASN values of MDS sampling plan is less than ASN values of other methods, and also the ASN values of different variable sampling plans based on Bayesian approach is less than ASN values obtained using exact approach.";"Process capability index; Resubmitted lot; Average sample number (ASN); Bayesian approach; Exact approach";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The mathematical model considered incorporates a number of important manufacturing attributes. These attributes include demand fluctuation, system reconfiguration, lot splitting, work load balancing, alternative routing, machine capability, tooling requirements, material handling cost, machine relocation cost, setup cost, inventory carrying cost, in-house production, and subcontracting costs. Optimal solutions for such comprehensive mathematical models can only be found for small size problems due to NP-complexity. To solve the model for large size problems, efficient meta-heuristic algorithm is required. The development of such an algorithm is the main contribution of this paper. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the computational performance of the developed algorithm and illustrate a challenge that may be encountered when one tries to embed a linear programming in a metaheuristic.;"Distributed layout; Dynamic reconfiguration; Production planning; Simulated annealing algorithm; Linear programming";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The manufacture of a thin-film transistor–liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) array is a complex process that uses large machines and automated material handling systems. Consequently, the relocation of machines for the manufacture of a TFT-LCD array is unrealistic and cost prohibitive. Virtual cells can be reconfigured using production control mechanisms without physically relocating the machines. This improves the cellular manufacturing system. This is an exploratory study for the design of a virtual cell design for TFT-LCD array manufacturing. The virtual cell design is dynamically reconfigured based on the product mix changes, in order to retain the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. A practical case is used for empirical illustration. The results show that the average improvements in terms of cycle time and the level of work-in-process are 23.73 and 23.59 %, respectively. The empirical results show that the proposed methodology is successful in a practical application.;"Automated material handling system; Cellular manufacturing; Discrete event simulation; Heuristics; TFT-LCD array; Virtual cell";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To enhance patient safety and reduce errors, surgeons must be trained in environments that mimic the actual clinical setting. Rasmussen’s model of human behavior indicates that errors in surgical procedures may be skill-, rule-, or knowledge-based. While skill-based behavior and some rule-based behavior may be taught using box trainers and ex vivo or in vivo animal models, we posit that multimodal immersive virtual reality (iVR) that includes high-fidelity visual as well as other sensory feedback in a seamless fashion provides the only means of achieving true surgical expertise by addressing all three levels of human behavior. While the field of virtual reality is not new, realization of the goals of complete immersion is challenging and has been recognized as a Grand Challenge by the National Academy of Engineering.

Dealing with changes and disruptions affecting an assembly station is a complex process which requires deep knowledge of the assembly process, the product being assembled and the adopted technologies. Shop-floor operators typically perform a series of adjustments by trial and error until the expected results in terms of performance and quality are achieved. With the proposed approach, such adjustments are captured and their effect on the station is measured. Adaptation knowledge is then derived by generalising from individual cases using a variant of the k-nearest neighbour algorithm. The operator is informed about potential adaptations whenever the station enters a state similar to one contained in the experience base, that is, a state on which adaptation information has been captured. A case study is presented, showing how the technique enables to reduce adaptation times.

The multivariate complexity increases the computation difficulty of multivariate process capability indices(MPCI), which makes them hard to be used in practice. In this paper, a new PCA-based MPCI approach is proposed to assess the production capability of the processes that involve multiple product quality characteristics. This approach first transforms the original quality variables into standardized normal variables. MPCI measures are then provided based on the Taam index. Moreover, the statistical properties of these MPCIs, such as confidence intervals and lower confidence bound, are given to let the practitioners understand the capability indices as random variables instead of deterministic variables. A real manufacturing data set and a synthetic data set are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. An implementation procedure is also provided for quality engineers to apply our MPCI approach in their manufacturing processes. The case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of this new kind of MPCI, which is easier to be used in production practice. The proposed research provides a novel approach of MPCI calculation.;"process capability index; multivariate; specification region; principal component analysis; confidence interval";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To overcome this limitation, a drawback of an excessive dependence on up-to-date information about the products and other elements that move within the system is essential. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a new emerging technology which uses radio frequency waves to transfer data between a reader and movable item for identification, tracking, and categorization purpose. This paper discusses the architecture devised to deploy RFID-enabled distributed control and monitoring system by means of a set of agents that are responsible for the realization of different control and monitoring tasks and for cooperating to enhance agility, flexibility, and reconfigurability of manufacturing system.;"RFID; Multi-agent system; Distributed control system; FMS";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Model-Based Approaches for Advanced Software and Systems Engineering;It is not clearly understood, what high performance means for software development enterprises. Product development team performance has been investigated extensively in various industries, but software development teams and their knowledge-intensive work are still open to even fundamental questions and gaps. Software team performance is relative to the particular context. The performance outcomes of the teams are products of their specific capabilities, provided by the underlying software competencies. This paper proposes a high-performing software team capability analysis approach supported by provisional instrumentation. The goal of such an analyzer is to facilitate software teams and organizations to identify their essential capabilities and – in case of mismatches or weaknesses – to gauge the development of necessary ones. An industrial team case demonstrates how it is able to capture and characterize different team capability traits for performance analysis and improvement with respect to the overall aims of the software organization.;"software teams; performance management; capability development; process improvement; high-performing organization";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This requires alignment between IT and PSS business strategy. Business‐IT alignment (BIA) in a value network can raise the ability of partners to collaborate effectively and improve network performance. However, the theory of traditional firm‐level BIA is not tailored to the specific situations of PSS value networks. In this paper we investigate the applicability of BIA concepts and definitions at a PSS value network level. Alignment in firm-level literature looked at fit between business and IT capabilities. To substantiate this at a PSS value network level, we identified and classified generic value network business capabilities on the one hand and IT capabilities on the other hand. By exploring and discussing the interrelations between the two types of capability, a conceptual framework for understanding BIA in a PSS value network is derived.;"Product-service system; value network; business-IT alignment; business capabilities; IT capabilities; capability-based framework";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

User performance concerns, for example the likelihood of user errors and time needed for a user to complete tasks, are important areas of consideration. For safety-critical systems it is vital that tools are available to support the analysis of such properties before expensive design commitment has been made. In this work, we give a unified formal verification framework for integrating two kinds of analysis: (1) predicting bounds for task-completion times via exhaustive state-space exploration, and (2) detecting user-error related design issues. The framework is based on a generic model of cognitively plausible behaviour that captures assumptions about cognitive behaviour decided through a process of interdisciplinary negotiation. Assumptions made in an analysis, including those relating to the performance consequences of users recovering from likely errors, are also investigated in this framework. We further present a novel way of exploring the consequences of cognitive mismatches, on both correctness and performance grounds. We illustrate our analysis approach with a realistic medical device scenario: programming an infusion pump. We explore an initial pump design and then two variations based on features found in real designs, illustrating how the approach identifies both timing and human error issues.;"Human error; Formal verification; Performance; Medical devices; Model checking; SAL";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PSS design should be customised solutions which are aligned to integrated stakeholders' capabilities, a subject which the extant literature has not sufficiently addressed. This paper proposes a systematic framework for the PSS solution provider to address this aim and operationalizes this through software developed for PSS design which models stakeholders' individual activities and simulates their occurrences depending on their relations. The framework stresses that integrated stakeholders' capabilities define continuing ability to generate a desired operational outcome for the customers. The paper reports a PSS design case for a laser system manufacturer and then applies the framework to it. The industrial experts' views on this framework reveal that it helps to develop PSS design from a holistic systems approach which facilitates a change in the designer's mindset from a product-centric to a systems-centric. The level of trust and transparency required for this framework is argued to be absent in most industrial sectors, being one of the foremost limitations for implementation of PSS.;"Product-service system; Design; Framework; Simulation; Representation";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

(IEEE Transactions on Robotics 26(3):483–501, 2010 ) on a wheeled humanoid robot maneuvering in sloped terrains. We then test it for a variety of compliant whole-body behaviors including balance and kinesthetic mobility on irregular terrain, and Cartesian hand position tracking using the co-actuated (i.e. two joints are simultaneously actuated with one motor) robot’s upper body. The implementation serves as a hardware proof for a variety of whole-body control concepts that had previously been developed and tested in simulation. First, behaviors of two and three priority tasks are implemented and successfully executed on the humanoid hardware. In particular, first and second priority tasks are linearized in the task space through model feedback and then controlled through task accelerations. Postures, on the other hand, are shown to be asymptotically stable when using prioritized whole-body control structures and then successfully tested in the real hardware. To cope with irregular terrains, the base is modeled as a six degree of freedom floating system and the wheels are characterized through contact and rolling constraints. Finally, center of mass balance capabilities using whole-body compliant control and kinesthetic mobility are implemented and tested in the humanoid hardware to climb terrains with various slopes.;"Prioritized whole-body compliant control; Wheeled humanoid robot; Uneven terrain mobility";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Research innovations in areas such as the Web of Things are able to curtail some of these issues by creating scalable and sustainable environments like parking lots, which provide motorists with access to convenient parking spots. We present a scalable parking lot network infrastructure that exposes parking management operations through a judicious mashup of physical things’ services within a parking lot. Our system uses service-oriented architecture, allowing motorists to reserve parking spots in advance. In doing so, our proposed system leverages the use of HTTP and Wi-Fi for the Web enablement and interoperability of things within a parking spot and elevates it as a Smart Parking Spot on the Web. Our suggested semantic Web-based structure for representing things makes it possible to query physical things’ states and services depending on their capabilities and other relevant parking-related parameters. Our performance evaluation reveals that a maximum of 40 % time is saved to find parking spots and also 40 % reduction in air pollution is observed.;"Smart parking; Sensor networks; Web of Things; Web services; Semantic Web";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Hence, the sustainability performance tends to become a strategic goal that FVs’ operators and decision makers (e.g., transport agents, warehouse providers and freight forwarders, logistics operators, and FV management company) endeavor to achieve. However, due to the lack of a systematic approach toward FVs sustainable development, existing literature has not yet clearly defined what strategic direction should be followed to pursue such a goal. This article proposes a knowledge-related approach to promote sustainability performance of FVs. This article highlights sustainability as a strategic goal of FVs rooting in the evidences from academia and practical cases. In addition, it explains the principle of ensuring sustainability by FVs with twofold meanings. Meanwhile, it summarizes the sustainability dimensions in the context of FVs. After introducing the significances of knowledge assets and knowledge management (KM) approach to the sustainability drawing on the implications from sustainability balanced scorecard (SBSC), it analyses KM characteristics in logistics and FVs area. Then, how the general KM process (knowledge acquisition, sharing, and application) act on FVs sustainable development is clarified. In which, the sustainability-related stakeholders of FVs are identified. Finally, it proposes a roadmap of organizing KM for sustainability-oriented FVs considering the distinct features of KM in FVs context. To support the success of this roadmap, this article recognizes two key elements including human ability and stakeholders’ involvement. Furthermore, a checklist for building FVs sustainability capability based on SBSC is provided, which is hopefully being a referring guidance for FVs’ operators and decision makers.;"Sustainability performance; Freight village; Knowledge; Knowledge management";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With software teams, however, the concept is still incompletely comprehended. Software teams in practice do not reside in isolation but in specific organizational contexts and, consequently, competitive environments. Their performance is thus relative to the particular context. The performance outcomes of the teams are in turn products of their specific capabilities (including agile), provided by the underlying software competencies. This paper proposes a high-performing software team capability analysis approach supported by provisional instrumentation. The aim of such a capability analyzator is to help software teams and organizations to identify their current capabilities and – in case of gaps – to gauge the development of necessary ones.

The surface position tolerance (SPT) method offers several advantages in comparison with the tolerance charting technique. These advantages arise from the separate consideration of the datum and machining surface position capabilities. To solve the problem of tolerance balancing, the mathematical model used in the literature is adapted to the SPT method. When solving the problem, the objective of maximizing process tolerances was chosen. The proposal was applied to a problem that has been used by many authors in the literature and so a wide comparison can be made of the results. The solution enables the tolerances in the process to be improved and the solution can also be optimized with respect to the capability of the fixture.;"Tolerance balancing; Optimization; Tolerance modeling; Locating error; Machining process";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

According to the occurrence and evolution of natural disaster system with complicated and nonlinear characteristics, a non-linear information dynamics mode is introduced based on the maximum flux principle during modeling process to study the integrated risk assessment of complex disaster system. Based on the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics method, a stochastic evolution equation of this system is established. The integrated risk assessment of complex disaster system can be achieved by giving reasonable weights of each evaluation index to stabilize the system. The new model reveals the formation pattern of risk grade and the dynamics law of evolution.

John";Investigating designers’ and users’ cognitive representations of products to assist inclusive interaction design;2013;Universal Access in the Information Society;There is strong evidence of the importance of good interaction design in the creation of intuitive-use products. However, there is also a strong indication, both in the literature and in the study with designers documented in this paper, that despite this evidence designers get little support in adequately representing, analysing and comparing design and user information. Since designers require a practical and relatively easy-to-use support tool that would enable them to better understand cognitive processes of users and evaluate the accessibility and usability of different product features, this paper proposes the Goals-Actions-Beliefs-Objects (GABO) modelling approach that can form the basis of such a tool for designers. The four distinct stages of the GABO approach are designed to assess and compare designers and users’ understanding and usage of everyday products. The evaluation results of the GABO approach with eight product designers have indicated that designers find it useful and effective in identifying the key similarities and differences in the understanding of designers and users.;"Inclusive design; Mental models; Product design; Cognition; Prior experience; Approach to modelling user understanding";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The challenges include robustness of network components, poor or non-existent power supply and sustainable business models. We argue that large scale user-driven community networks are becoming technically viable to deploy in areas that are short of supply of telecommunication services due to little or no commercial interest. To support this claim, we discuss the design of key network elements and careful power management based on alternative energy sources and storage. We also provide a status report from ongoing field-tests regarding provisioning of broadband network services in Serengeti, Tanzania, and outline briefly our strategy to achieve sustainability. On the technical side, we first discuss an affordable, high-performance, low-effect router based on open source software and standard off-the-shelf hardware offering both copper and fibre links. Our design is capable of forwarding more than 700 kpps at 22.3 W. The power consumption is considerably less than all alternatives in our comparison.

The function principle of the sensor is detecting the cumulative mass of NPs deposited on the cantilever surface as a shift in its resonant frequency. A self-sensing method with an integrated full Wheatstone bridge on the cantilever as a piezoresistive strain gauge is introduced for signal readout replacing optical sensing method. For trapping NPs to the cantilever surface, an electrostatic field is used. The calculated equivalent mass-induced resonant frequency shift due to NPs sampling is measured to be 11.78 ± 0.01 ng. The proposed sensor exhibits a mass sensitivity of 8.33 Hz/ng, a quality factor of 1,230.68 ± 78.67, and a temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency ( TC _ f ) of −28.6 ppm/°C.

Such delivery models are characterized by a common pool of skilled agents who collectively support the service needs of several customers at a time. The ticket scheduling problem becomes interesting in this scenario due to the need to provide satisfactory experience to multiple customers with different Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in a cost-efficient and optimal way, by intelligently leveraging the available skill set and balancing workload across agents. We present a detailed description of the problem domain and introduce a novel metric for estimating the relative criticality of tickets from different customers at any point in time, taking into account several factors such as the distance from SLA breach, the SLA penalty and the expected volume of tickets during the rest of the service time window. This criticality measure is used within a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) based solution approach to the ticket scheduling problem, where we consider the objectives of SLA penalty minimization, balancing breaches across customers, load balancing across agents, and maximizing skill match. Due to the complexity of the problem, optimization engines may not always return feasible or efficient solutions within reasonable time limits. Hence, we also develop a custom heuristic algorithm that returns acceptable solutions very fast. Detailed simulation experiments are used to compare these approaches and to demonstrate their efficiency in meeting the scheduling objectives of shared delivery.;"Mixed Integer Programming; Service Level Agreement; Mixed Integer Programming Model; Mixed Integer Programming Formulation; Total Penalty";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Traditional prospective risk analysis methods typically capture one risk at a time and rely on the specification of a chronological sequence of errors occurring in combination. The aim here is to introduce agent-based risk assessment (ABRA), which addresses these issues by simulating multiple concurrent and sequential interactions amongst autonomous agents that act according to their own goals. The methodology underlying the construction, simulation and validation of ABRA models is detailed along with practical considerations associated with implementation, for which the Brahms agent-based simulation framework is used. The challenges of implementing agent-based risk assessment models include the need for well-defined work processes and reliable observational data, and difficulties associated with behavioural validation. As an example illustrating the technique, a simple race condition hazard is implemented using an ABRA model. The work process involves a human operator and a machine interface that interact to sometimes produce the erroneous transfer of information. The correctness of the model is confirmed by comparing the simulated results against the well-defined theoretical baseline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There are often multiple, competing objectives based on which we assess the outcome of optimization. Since accurate, high fidelity models are typically time consuming and computationally expensive, comprehensive evaluations can be conducted only if an efficient framework is available. Furthermore, informed decisions of the model/hardware’s overall performance rely on an adequate understanding of the global, not local, sensitivity of the individual design variables on the objectives. The surrogate-based approach, which involves approximating the objectives as continuous functions of design variables from limited data, offers a rational framework to reduce the number of important input variables, i.e., the dimension of a design or modeling space. In this paper, we review the fundamental issues that arise in surrogate-based analysis and optimization, highlighting concepts, methods, techniques, as well as modeling implications for mechanics problems. To aid the discussions of the issues involved, we summarize recent efforts in investigating cryogenic cavitating flows, active flow control based on dielectric barrier discharge concepts, and lithium (Li)-ion batteries.

Design guidelines for human-automation interaction aim to avoid such issues and commonly agree that the human should have continuous interaction and communication with the automation system and its authority level and should retain final authority. This paper argues that haptic shared control is a promising approach to meet the commonly voiced design guidelines for human-automation interaction, especially for automotive applications. The goal of the paper is to provide evidence for this statement, by discussing several realizations of haptic shared control found in literature. We show that literature provides ample experimental evidence that haptic shared control can lead to short-term performance benefits (e.g., faster and more accurate vehicle control; lower levels of control effort; reduced demand for visual attention). We conclude that although the continuous intuitive physical interaction inherent in haptic shared control is expected to reduce long-term issues with human-automation interaction, little experimental evidence for this is provided. Therefore, future research on haptic shared control should focus more on issues related to long-term use such as trust, overreliance, dependency on the system, and retention of skills.";"Automation; Human–machine interface; Haptic guidance; Shared control; Neuromuscular identification; Levels of automation; Force feedback";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Such impellers can economically enable refrigeration plants to use water as a refrigerant (R718).

Numerical simulation using FEM for two-dimensional and three-dimensional impellers was investigated. A commercially available software ANSYS is used for the finite element calculations. Analysis is done for different blade geometries and then suggestions are made for optimum design parameters. In order to avoid operating at resonance, which can make impellers suffer a significant reduction in the design life, the designer must calculate the natural frequency and modal shape of the impeller to analyze the dynamic characteristics. The results show that using composite Kevlar fiber/epoxy matrix enables the impeller to run at high tip speed and withstand the stresses, no critical speed will be matched during start-up and shut-down, and that mass imbalances of the impeller shall not pose a critical problem.;"Strength; Dynamic characteristics; FEA; Composite material; Axial-impeller";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Previous studies in peer-to-peer and sensor networks have shown the efficiency of probabilistic algorithms in object or resource discovery. In this paper we maintain confidence in such mechanisms and extend the work for the purpose of agent discovery for useful pairs that eventually coordinate to enhance their collective performance. The key difference in our mechanism is the use of domain-specific data that allows the discovery of relevant, useful agents while maintaining reduced communication costs. Agents employ a Bayesian inference model to control an otherwise random search, such that at each step a decision procedure determines whether it is worth searching further. In this way it attempts to capture something akin to the human disposition to give up after trying a certain number of alternatives and take the best offer seen. We benchmark the approach against exhaustive search (to establish an upper bound on costs), random and tabu—all of which it outperforms—and against an independent industrial standard simulator—which it also outperforms. We demonstrate using synthetic data—for the purpose of exploring the resilience of the approaches to extreme workloads—and empirical data, the effectiveness of a system that can identify “good enough” solutions to satisfy holistic organisational service level objectives.;"Multiagent System; Service Discovery; Resource Discovery; Query Message; Good Pair";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They fail, however, to maximize a healthy return on investment. This paper explores factors that influence requirements process improvement (RPI) with the aim to explain how the attributes of the underpinning process affect both the quality and associated costs of the requirements specification delivered to the customer. Although several tools and techniques have been proposed and used for RPIs, many lack a systematic approach to RPI or fail to provide RPI teams with the required understanding to assess their effectivity. The authors contend that the developed quality-cost RPI descriptive model is a generic framework, discipline and language for an effective approach to RPI. This descriptive model allows a systematic enquiry that yields explanations and provides RPI stakeholders with a common decision making framework. The descriptive model was validated by practicing process improvement consultants and managers and makes a contribution towards understanding of the quality-cost dynamics of RPI. To address the acknowledged deficiencies of RPI, the authors further suggest a generic RPI model and approach that integrates statistical process control (SPC) into system dynamics (SD). The approach enables RPI teams to steer for a cost-effective and successful RPI.;"cost; quality; Requirements process improvement; system dynamics; statistical process control";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

H.; Ahmad, Noraziah; Alla, Ahmed N Abd; Sultan, E.

This ensures that the remote copy of data that is identical to the primary copy is created at the same time the primary copy is updated. However, most of the synchronous replication does not consider the heterogeneous system. In this paper, a software persistence layer for heterogeneous synchronous replication has been designed and developed based on multi-threading known as PLSR. The main objective of this strategy is to make the persistence layer adaptive and make the synchronous replication process reliable and faster than other existing replication processes concerning cost minimization. In the proposed PLSR replication technique, the replication servers are OS independent and the entire replication process is not inter dependent nevertheless on the main server. Adding a new replication server is easier than other processes. The technique also introduces the modification of replication servers without making impairment to the entire process. The comparative Results with SQL server data replication show the PLSR is more acceptable in terms of transactional insertions and sync time. The result shows that PLSR outstanding performs 88.5 % faster than SQL server for transactional insert.;"Data replication; Synchronous; Heterogeneous replication; Multi-threading technique; Software persistence layer";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Therefore, measuring the strategic and inter-organizational alignment based on key alignment indicators (KAIs) can be an excellent alternative to improve performance evaluation systems.

In this contribution, a human performance analysis of process model development paying special attention to the concept of human error was conducted. It was found that the frequencies of the omissions and erroneous executions of notation elements are significantly higher for novices than for experienced modelers.

The cell’s numerical control – termed a cognitive control unit (CCU) – is able to simulate human information processing at a rule-based level of cognitive control on the basis of the SOAR cognitive architecture. Thus the CCU can plan assembly processes autonomously and can react to changes in assembly processes due to increasing number of products that have to be assembled in a large variety in production space as well as changing or uncertain conditions. To develop a “Humanoid-Mode” for automated assembly systems similar to the H-metaphor for automated vehicles human assembly strategies where identified in empirical investigations and formulated as production rules.

Easy implementation, selection of programming or self-learning modes depending on the characteristics of the application, and capability of distributing the smart nodes to physically separated locations make the IBR a good candidate for diagnostic of manufacturing processes either at the tool, machine, and work cell level. For chatter detection, programming mode was used for preparation of the lookup table. For wear estimation, lookup table was automatically generated from very limited training cases (only three) by detecting the trend.

A new methodology is described that helps overcome the effect of measurement uncertainty in order to obtain a more accurate assessment of the capability of the production processes. This methodology presents a solution that ensures the metrological confirmation of the measurement processes, and it was developed for manufacturing processes centred at a nominal value and for off-centred processes.

In accordance with these recommendations, the Evolvable Production Systems (EPS) has aimed at developing such technological solutions and support mechanisms. Since its inception in 2002 as a next generation of production systems, the concept is being further developed and tested to emerge as a production system paradigm. The essence of evolvability resides not only in the ability of system components to adapt to the changing conditions of operation, but also to assist in the evolution of these components in time such that processes may become self-X, x standing for one more desirable properties of a system subjected to a variable operation condition such as self-evolvable, self-reconfigurable, self-tuning, self-diagnosing, etc. Characteristically, Evolvable systems have distributed control, and are composed of intelligent modules integrated.

Non repayment of such credits cause many problems to the banks such as incapability to repay the central bank’s loans, increasing the amount of credit allocations comparing to credit repayment and incapability to allocate more credits to customers. The importance of credit allocation in banking industry and it’s important role in economic growth and employment creation leads the development of many models to evaluate the credit risk of applicants. But many of these models are classic and are incapable to do credit evaluation completely and efficiently. Therefore the demand to use artificial intelligence in this field has grown up. In this paper after providing appropriate credit ranking model and collecting expert’s knowledge, we design a hybrid intelligent system for credit ranking using reasoning-transformational models. Expert system as symbolic module and artificial neural network as non-symbolic module are components of this hybrid system. Such models provide the unique features of each components, the reasoning and explanation of expert system and the generalization and adaptability of artificial neural networks.

The hypothesis that persuasive technologies can contribute to improve safety was empirically confirmed in a study carried out on a real PPMS. It has been observed that this PPMS implements a persuasion strategy called tunnelling, aimed at forcing the operators to strictly follow a step-by-step and start-to-end execution of the tasks. First, a survey was conducted on a sample of 13 operators in order to investigate the role played by the PPMS, comparing it with the “functional triad” proposed by Fogg (Persuasive technology. Using computers to change what we think and do. Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, San Francisco, 2002 ). Then, an analysis on production volumes and accidents revealed that the PPMS actually encourages safer behaviours and contributed to a reduction of the number of dangerous slips and lapses since its adoption.;"Persuasive technologies; Risk management; Safety; Incident prevention; Human error";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Errors in the upgrade procedure, such as broken dependencies, constitute the leading cause of upgrade failures. We propose a novel upgrade-centric fault model, based on data from three independent sources, which focuses on the impact of procedural errors rather than software defects. We show that current approaches for upgrading enterprise systems, such as rolling upgrades, are vulnerable to these faults because the upgrade is not an atomic operation and it risks breaking hidden dependencies among the distributed system-components. We also present a mechanism for tolerating complex procedural errors during an upgrade. Our system, called Imago, improves availability in the fault-free case, by performing an online upgrade, and in the faulty case, by reducing the risk of failure due to breaking hidden dependencies. Imago performs an end-to-end upgrade atomically and dependably by dedicating separate resources to the new version and by isolating the old version from the upgrade procedure. Through fault injection, we show that Imago is more reliable than online-upgrade approaches that rely on dependency-tracking and that create system states with mixed versions.;"Application Server; Enterprise System; Software Defect; Latent Error; Atomic Operation";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The application of such models, and in particular the ISO/IEC 15504, determined a general software process improvement in many domains. Nevertheless, the application of the ISO/IEC 15504 standard is still considered by many agile developers as incompatible with agile approaches. Such an attitude is mainly based on common misunderstandings on what the ISO/IEC 15504 is and on what its application involves.

As electronic systems design can no longer be seen as an isolated hardware design activity, UML becomes of significant interest as a unification language for systems description combining both HW and SW components. This article provides a comprehensive view of the UML applied to System-on-Chip (SoC) and hardware-related embedded systems design. The modeling concepts in the UML language are first introduced, including major diagrams for the representation of the behavior and the structure of systems. The principles behind application specific UML customizations (UML profiles) are summarized, and several examples relevant for SoC design are given, such as the SysML (System Modeling Language) and the SoC Profile. Thereafter, various approaches associating UML with existing HW/SW design languages are presented. Beyond language aspects, the article addresses the question of UML-based design flows, and shows how UML can be applied concretely to the development of electronic-based systems. The current situation about tool support constitutes the last focus of the article. In particular, we show how UML tools can be combined with well-known simulation environments, such as MATLAB.;"UML; SysML; Model-based design; System specification; Modelling languages";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Previous research focused on process tolerances or robust tolerance design with little consideration on real manufacturing context. This paper presents a nonlinear method for robust tolerance design based on the real manufacturing context in three stages. The objective function to be minimized is the total manufacturing cost. The constraint equations for the optimization model are also deduced, which select suitable manufacturing processes based on the manufacturing environment. Simulation annealing (SA) is used for the nonlinear optimization. The approach is finally illustrated by a practical example.

This model begins to address these issues by integrating predictive learning, sequence interleaving, and sequence creation components to simulate a spectrum of higher-order cognitive behaviors which have eluded the grasp of simpler systems. Its capabilities are described based on simulations calling for increasing levels of functionality and are used to show how the model can progress from fundamental sequence learning and recall tasks to sophisticated behaviors such as an ability to solve simple mathematical expressions and a creative capacity for the formation and application of inductive rules.;"Predictive learning; Memory interleaving; Creativity; Inductive reasoning; Autonomous neural networks";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

OWL-S (“OWL for Services”) is a set of notations for expressing such specifications, based on the Semantic Web ontology language OWL. It consists of three interrelated parts: a profile ontology, used to describe what the service does; a process ontology and corresponding presentation syntax, used to describe how the service is used; and a grounding ontology, used to describe how to interact with the service. OWL-S can be used to automate a variety of service-related activities involving service discovery, interoperation, and composition.

In today’s networked environment, it is not uncommon for organizations representing different business partners to collaborate for providing value-added services and products. As such, workflows representing the business processes in this loosely-coupled, dynamic and ad hoc coalition environment tend to span across the organizational boundaries. As a result, it is not viable to employ a single centralized WFMS to control the execution of the inter-organizational workflow due to limited scalability, availability and performance. To this end, in this paper, we present a decentralized workflow model , where inter-task dependencies are enforced without requiring to have a centralized WFMS. In our model, a workflow is divided into partitions called self-describing workflows , and handled by a light weight workflow management component, called the workflow stub , located at each organization. We present a performance study by considering different types of workflows with varying degrees of parallelism. Our performance results indicate that decentralized workflow management indeed enjoys significant gain in performance over its centralized counterpart in cases where there is less parallelism.;"Decentralized workflow execution; Self-describing workflow; Workflow partition; Dependency split; Workflow stub; Evaluation of workflow execution";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper presents techniques which may be used to assess test capability and hence the implied test quality costs of PCB level electronic circuits. The techniques presented are based on the electronic Conformability Analysis (eCA) approach which combines process capability indices and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis with a cost mapping procedure. It introduces a new measure of test capability based on the widely used process capability measure C _pk. This analysis allows the quality costs associated with design and manufacture induced faults to be estimated and the effectiveness of test strategies in reducing these costs to be determined. It allows the trade-off between quality costs and the component, manufacturing process and test costs to be explored. The technique has been applied to analogue & mixed signal, safety critical circuits from automotive systems.;"quality; test escapes; test coverage; design for test; test capability; process capability; electronics design";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In Mills et al. (Adapting to memory pressure from within scientific applications on multiprogrammed COWS. In: International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, IPDPS, Santa Fe, NM, 2004 ), we introduced a basic framework for a runtime, user-level library, MM lib , in which DRAM is treated as a dynamic size cache for large memory objects residing on local disk. Application developers can specify and access these objects through MM lib , enabling their application to execute optimally under variable memory availability, using as much DRAM as fluctuating memory levels will allow. In this paper, we first extend our earlier MM lib prototype from a proof of concept to a usable, robust, and flexible library. We present a general framework that enables fully customizable memory malleability in a wide variety of scientific applications. We provide several necessary enhancements to the environment sensing capabilities of MM lib , and introduce a remote memory capability, based on MPI communication of cached memory blocks between ‘compute nodes’ and designated memory servers. The increasing speed of interconnection networks makes a remote memory approach attractive, especially at the large granularity present in large scientific applications. We show experimental results from three important scientific applications that require the general MM lib framework. The memory-adaptive versions perform nearly optimally under constant memory pressure and execute harmoniously with other applications competing for memory, without thrashing the memory system. Under constant memory pressure, we observe execution time improvements of factors between three and five over relying solely on the virtual memory system. With remote memory employed, these factors are even larger and significantly better than other, system-level remote memory implementations.;"Memory management; Shared computational pools; Network RAM; Scientific libraries; Autonomic computing";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

After a brief reminder of the nature of design processes, it is argued that this production depends on the way the system design process is conducted, and in particular on the extent to which end users are involved in the design process. However, one thing is to design for safety, another thing is to make sure that, over time, systems continue to function safely. Systems are unstable and evolve after their implementation. The next part thus considers these evolutions (and in particular the migration effects) and the way in which negative effects of migrations on safety can be prevented. The development model proposed by Amartya Sen and its implications for the design of safety enabling environments are then presented.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These models cover different perspectives including the control-flow, resource, and data perspectives. This paper focuses on the resource perspective , i.e., the way the system distributes work based on the structure of the organization and capabilities/qualifications of people. Contemporary workflow management systems offer a wide variety of mechanisms to support the resource perspective. Because the resource perspective is essential for the applicability of such systems, it is important to better understand the mechanisms and their interactions. Our goal is not to evaluate and compare what different systems do, but to understand how they do it. We use Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) to model work distribution mechanisms. First, we provide a basic model that can be seen as a reference model of existing workflow management systems. This model is then extended for three specific systems (Staffware, FileNet, and FLOWer). Moreover, we show how more advanced work distribution mechanisms, referred to as resource patterns , can be modelled and analyzed.;"Work Item; Allocation Function; Work Distribution; Stop Work; Short Queue";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this two-part paper, the key results obtained during a 3-year research programme aiming at establishing such a capability based on a better understanding of the fluid mechanics of synthetic jets and an improved modelling capacity are reported. In Part 1 of this paper, the experimental studies of the behaviour of synthetic jets in both quiescent flow and a boundary layer are described. The work has led to an improved understanding of the dimensionless parameters that determine the formation and development of vortex rollup and how the strength of rollup can be enhanced by optimizing the geometry and operating condition. Based on the study of the nature of vortical structures produced as the result of the interaction with a boundary layer and their impact in the near-wall region where flow control is desired, the conditions for producing effective vortical structures for delaying flow separation were established.

Such a framework needs to make development and use of application workflows dramatically easier so that scientists’ efforts can shift away from data management and utility software development to scientific research and discovery.

N.";A multi-stage methodology for virtual cell formation oriented agile manufacturing;2008;The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology;In recent years, as an emerging concept in industry, agile manufacturing has attracted considerable attention, combining virtual manufacturing cells to construct new manufacturing systems to respond to the changing market needs, especially in nonlinear processes. In this paper, a multi-stage cell formation methodology, which can help select appropriate resources and form the VCs, is presented. First, appropriate resources for completing production tasks are selected by a LP model considering the available capacity and the costs. In order to form VC in a logical mode, parts having alternative product process routings as multi-functional machines are analyzed by a resource element approach. Furthermore, some routing-based heuristic rules are introduced to optimize the candidate VCs in the form of resource elements. Finally a case study is used to illustrate the detailed formation methodology.;"Agile manufacturing; Virtual cell; Nonlinear process plan; Resource element";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
420;Dimensional and geometrical tolerance balancing in concurrent design;10.1007/s00170-006-0749-2;Springer;"Huang, Meifa; Zhong, Yanru";Dimensional and geometrical tolerance balancing in concurrent design;2008;The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology;In conventional design, tolerancing is divided into two separated sequential stages, i.e., product tolerancing and process tolerancing. In product tolerancing stage, the assembly functional tolerances are allocated to BP component tolerances. In the process tolerancing stage, the obtained BP tolerances are further allocated to the process tolerances in terms of the given process planning. As a result, tolerance design often results in conflict and redesign. An optimal design methodology for both dimensional and geometrical tolerances (DGTs) is presented and validated in a concurrent design environment. We directly allocate the required functional assembly DGTs to the pertinent process DGTs by using the given process planning of the related components. Geometrical tolerances are treated as the equivalent bilateral dimensional tolerances or the additional tolerance constraints according to their functional roles and engineering semantics in manufacturing. When the process sequences of the related components have been determined in the assembly structure design stage, we formulate the concurrent tolerance chains to express the relations between the assembly DGTs and the related component process DGTs by using the integrated tolerance charts. Concurrent tolerancing which simultaneously optimizes the process tolerance based on the constraints of concurrent DGTs and the process accuracy is implemented by a linear programming approach. In the optimization model the objective is to maximize the total weight process DGTs while weight factor is used to evaluate the different manufacturing costs between different means of manufacturing operations corresponding to the same tolerance value. Economical tolerance bounds of related operations are given as constraints. Finally, an example is included to demonstrate the proposed methodology.;"Concurrent design; Dimensional and geometrical tolerance; Integrated tolerance chart; Optimization; Process accuracy; Process planning";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

G.; Gao, L.";An agent- and service-based collaborative design architecture under a dynamic integration environment;2007;The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology;The shortening of product realization times and the increase of product complication require multidisciplinary experts to cooperate dynamically and closely in the whole product development lifecycle, behavior that has been previously unfamiliar. To further improve the design cooperation efficiency under this environment, this paper presents a novel cooperative design architecture using revolutionary Internet, agent, and semantic Web technologies. Based on the concept of service provision, intelligent Web-agent groups act as the function backbone to organize the service-based running of the system. Multidisciplinary product development units can be dynamically formed and configured in a knowledge-integration perspective. The layer-based architecture encapsulates distributed knowledge at a higher abstract level and coordinates lifecycle activities from different domains. Semantic-rich service expression and intelligent service accessing through agent mediation make the system more flexible. Within this dynamic cooperative environment, all of the participants involved and their distributed knowledge can be integrated as a whole to achieve more efficient and more intelligent design cooperation.;"Collaborative design; Web service; Semantic Web; Injection mold";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper describes the development of a road traffic simulation system, which uses a ‘nanoscopic model’ of driver behaviour and an integrated analysis-evaluation system designed for traffic safety assessment. The primary focus is on estimating the effects of an advanced driver assistance system thereby reducing traffic accidents. The effectiveness and validity of the present system are demonstrated through comparison with measured traffic data. This paper also proposes algorithms embedded in a ‘driver-agent’, for recognising driver’s intentions regarding choosing steering-control modes, lateral control tasks, and the driving mood. This is because the driver assistance systems need to recognise the driver’s intention when choosing steering-control. The results of a simulation study, using the data drawn from actual driving, show that the systems would achieve a high recognition capability. As an example of how driving mood recognition applies to driver assistance systems, an advanced steering system and the adaptability to the driver’s mood, have also been presented.;"Driver model; Road traffic simulation; Driver assistance systems; Agent-based simulation; Driver’s intention; Recognition";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SEI presents PSP and TSP to establish personal and team capabilities in the software process, to maintain them and assist organizations in conducting CMMI-Based process improvement. Thus, executors’ capabilities should be taken into account as a key issue of the software process modeling method. ISCAS conducts research on Organization-Entities capabilities- based software process modeling and presents a corresponding method. The Organization-Entities have definite capabilities and are called Process-Agents. The modeling method applies Agent technology to organize the basic process units and to establish the project process system self-adaptively according to the special project goal and constraining environment. In this paper, we present the method for constructing the Process-Agent.

This opportunity naturally requires a methodology to assess to what extent the legacy e-services are transformed to the uT-based services. However, research about assessing the level of u-Transformation has been still very few. Hence, this paper aims to propose a methodology for assessing the level of u-Transformation oriented by the teleology of ubiquitous services.

Because their primary task is classification, they do nothing to prevent an attack from succeeding. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) adds protection mechanisms that provide fail–safe semantics, automatic response capabilities, and adaptive enforcement. We present FLIPS (Feedback Learning IPS), a hybrid approach to host security that prevents binary code injection attacks. It incorporates three major components: an anomaly-based classifier, a signature-based filtering scheme, and a supervision framework that employs Instruction Set Randomization (ISR). Since ISR prevents code injection attacks and can also precisely identify the injected code, we can tune the classifier and the filter via a learning mechanism based on this feedback. Capturing the injected code allows FLIPS to construct signatures for zero-day exploits. The filter can discard input that is anomalous or matches known malicious input, effectively protecting the application from additional instances of an attack – even zero-day attacks or attacks that are metamorphic in nature. FLIPS does not require a known user base and can be deployed transparently to clients and with minimal impact on servers. We describe a prototype that protects HTTP servers, but FLIPS can be applied to a variety of server and client applications.;"Adaptive Response; Intrusion Prevention; Intrusion Tolerance";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MOMI's key idea is structuring mobile object-oriented code by using mixin-based inheritance. Mobile code is compiled and typed locally, and can interact successfully with code present on foreign sites only if its type is subtyping-compliant with the type of what is expected by the receiving site. The key feature of the paper is the definition of this subtyping relation on classes and mixins that enables a significantly flexible, yet still simple, communication pattern. We show that communication by subtyping is type-safe in that exchanged code is merged into local code without requiring further type analysis and recompilation.;"Information System; Operating System; Data Structure; Communication Network; Information Theory";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Despite the recent advances in Web based access control approaches applicable to Web services, there remain issues that impede the development of effective access control models for Web services environment. Amongst them are the lack of context-aware models for access control, and reliance on identity or capability-based access control schemes. Additionally, the unique service access control features required in Web services technology are not captured in existing schemes. In this paper, we motivate the design of an access control scheme that addresses these issues, and propose an extended, trust-enhanced version of our XML-based Role Based Access Control (X-RBAC) framework that incorporates trust and context into access control. We outline the configuration mechanism needed to apply our model to the Web services environment, and provide a service access control specification.

It has also been suggested that performance measurement and strategic management should focus on the value creation process. In recent years, the balanced scorecard (BSC) has evolved to become a dominant strategic management mechanism and has been widely adopted in business sectors. However, a gap between BM and the BSC still hinders the usefulness and effectiveness of applying the BSC to the e-business domain. This paper aims at providing an integrated framework for linking the BSC to e-business models through identified values and strategies to facilitate strategic management activities. Value dimensions identified include market, supply chain, customer, enterprise, and product and service, and therefore the adapted value-based BSC framework contains market, supply chain, customer, as well as business structure and process as balanced perspectives.;"Supply Chain; Business Model; Strategic Management; Customer Relationship Management; Balance Scorecard";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The major difference between μ GAs and simple genetic algorithms (SGAs) is how to make a reproductive plan for an improved searching technique because of population choice. It is shown that μ GAs implementation reaches the near-optimal region much earlier than the SGAs approach, and the μ GAs give a better solution than simulated annealing (SA). The main objective was to determine what temperature distribution can be obtained from the solution of a travelling distributed heat source. The solution of the travelling heat source on nested raw plate provides information about the vertices of each nested part of the raw plate. From the fact that the initial temperature at a piercing point strongly depends on the heat flow which stems from the previous cutting contour, the temperature of all piercing points must be lower than the critical temperature after each cutting of the components of a part. The critical temperature is identified as the mechanical melting temperature of steels. A heuristic back-tracking method is introduced to find the near-optimum cutting path considering the minimum heat effect on deformation. The heuristic back-tracking method is incorporated with the μ GAs.;"Microgenetic algorithms; Simple genetic algorithms; Simulated annealing; Travelling distributed heat source; Critical temperature; Heuristic back-tracking method";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In such a situation, the development of production systems is necessary. This can only be done via the development of all manufacturing system elements such as production methods, machines, process, control and information systems. One important part of manufacturing systems that is very often not appreciated enough is the human being. This paper focuses on the changing role of managers and machine operators. Problems regarding quality of human decisions, artificial intelligence support and a socio-technical design approach are discussed as well. The aim of this paper is to present the important factors that significantly influence the balanced development of advanced manufacturing systems. The article is the result of a research project focused on improving the cooperation between machine operators and technical systems in manufacturing companies.;"Manufacturing systems; Human factor; Computer integrated production; Socio-technical design; Man-machine interaction";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A secret boot block overlay is buried within a system ASIC. This secret boot block decrypts and verifies portions of an external FLASH-type ROM. The presence of the secret boot block is camouflaged by a decoy boot block in the external ROM. The code contained within the secret boot block is transferred to the CPU in the clear over a set of high-speed busses where it can be extracted using simple custom hardware. The paper concludes with recommendations for improving the Xbox security system. One lesson of this study is that the use of a high-performance bus alone is not a sufficient security measure, given the advent of inexpensive rapid prototyping services and affordable high-performance FPGAs.;"Reset Signal; FPGA Board; Kernel Image; Symmetric Cipher; Video Game Console";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

IBIS is based on the global-as-view approach, using a relational mediated schema to query the data at the sources. Sources are wrapped so as to provide a relational view on them. A key issue is that the system allows the specification of integrity constraints (modeling constraints in the domain of interest) in the global schema. Since sources are autonomous, the extracted data in general do not satisfy the constraints. IBIS adapts and integrates the data extracted from the sources making use of the constraints in the global schema, so as to answer queries at best with the information available. IBIS deals with limitations in accessing data sources, and exploits techniques developed for querying sources with access limitations in order to retrieve the maximum set of answers. In particular, it may use integrity constraints available on the sources to improve the efficiency of the extraction process.;"Query Processing; Global Schema; Integrity Constraint; Conjunctive Query; Abstract Domain";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Since most agents live in a dynamic environment, they also will often be confronted with situations in which the plans they constructed to reach their goals are no longer feasible. In such situations, agents have to change their plan to deal with the new environment.

In Lime, mobile programs are equipped with tuple spaces that move whenever the program moves and are transparently shared with tuple spaces of other co-located programs. The Lime specification is surprisingly complex and tricky to implement.

455;A Three-Layer Model for Workflow Semantic Recovery in an Object-Oriented Environment;10.1007/3-540-45581-7_40;Springer;Chiu, Dickson K. W.;A Three-Layer Model for Workflow Semantic Recovery in an Object-Oriented Environment;2001;Conceptual Modeling — ER 2001;There have been numerous attempts to provide semantic recovery workflow support in order to maintain atomicity and consistency. However, they concentrate on compensation activities for individual tasks. This paper propose a three-layer model to provide comprehensive recovery support in an advanced object-oriented workflow environment, which take cares many other properties and aspects of a workflow management system (WFMS). At the workflow layer, the workflow composition hierarchy, workflow semantics and workflow commitment determines recovery requirement and data objects affected. At the data object layer, object class properties, data dependencies determines data recovery requirement. At the recovery primitive layer, users can define different types of reusable primitives to address the above recovery requirements. Based on this model with respect to ADOME-WFMS, this paper illustrates how the problem of workflow recovery can be adequately addressed, especially from an exception-handling viewpoint. In particular, a novel webbased support for cooperative workflow semantic recovery is highlighted.;"Compensation Method; Transaction Model; Exception Handling; Recovery Manager; Nest Transaction";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

An activity consists of interdependent tasks. Exactly one agent (human, hardware/software system) executes a task. CapBasEDAMS is a capability based and event driven activity management system that supports specification and execution of activities using cooperative information systems paradigm. For each business process to be executed an activity instant is created and executed in CapBasEDAMS. Each task of an activity instant is assigned to an agent that executes the task. Therefore, when there are many activity instances executing at the same time many tasks are queued up at agents for execution. In order to speed up the completion of business process, the user can request that certain activity instances be speeded up. In this paper, we design algorithms for speeding up multiple activity instances at the same time by rescheduling activities in multiple agent queues. We evaluate these algorithms for both one-time speed up and multiple times speed up. Our results show that the multiple speed-up algorithm outperform the one-time speed-up algorithm.;"Business Process; Precedence Constraint; Activity Instance; Application Agent; Coordinator Agent";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Improved decision support systems are needed that optimally integrate people with computer-based systems in order to increase productivity and responsiveness. However, there is a dearth of knowledge on the reality of the human factors of planning and scheduling practice across manufacturing industry. This paper reviews previous studies of scheduling practice and demonstrates the lack of clearly reported and justified methods to study scheduling behaviour and to interpret and represent the findings. Field study is proposed as the most appropriate approach for carrying out studies of scheduling in practice and various methods used in scheduling field studies are specified.

In the defence area, especially that of aerospace systems, extensive use has been made of the expertise of software and system houses in developing validation methodologies (VORTEX), real time (MUSE) and multi-agent (D-MUSE) software and together with Universities, a knowledge acquisition toolkit (PC PACK). In the UK at DERA Farnborough within the Airborne Decision Support Group, Air Sector, these software and tools have been developed and applied to problems in building Decision Support Systems for Maritime Air applications. The demanding aircrew tasks are characterised by the need for assimilation and interpretation of multi sensor data to devise tactical responses in real time based on prevailing tactical doctrine and aircrew experience. The applications include Decision Support for Anti Submarine Warfare (ASW), Anti Surface Warfare (ASuW), Airborne Early Warning (AEW) together with ASW/ASuW and the proposed AEW technology demonstrators.

466;Real-time control and scheduling of flexible manufacturing systems: An ordinal optimisation based approach;10.1007/BF01438229;Springer;"Peng, Chong; Chen, F. Frank";Real-time control and scheduling of flexible manufacturing systems: An ordinal optimisation based approach;1998;The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology;A unique real-time control and scheduling framework for flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) is presented in this paper. The framework enables the adoption of different scheduling policies for short-term intervals when responding to the dynamic changes of the FMS shop floor status. Each time when rescheduling is called for, standard clock (SC) simulation is first employed to evaluate the performance of a set of scheduling policies for a short planning horizon. The ordinal optimisation concept is then used to choose quickly the most desirable scheduling policy. Owing to the use of the standard clock technique and the ordinal optimisation concept, this framework accomplishes a dramatic reduction in the time needed for decision making, the essential requirement for real-time control. It is also found that as the scale of the problem increases, the decision-making time increases linearly rather than exponentially. These two important features indicate that this framework has the potential for being successfully implemented in real FMS settings. Although the framework cannot always guarantee the global “best” performance, the case study indicates that satisfactory performance results are always achieved by using this framework.;"Coloured Petri net; Flexible manufacturing system; Ordinal optimisation; Scheduling and control; Standard clock";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We also introduce the network robotic system, which is a new trend in robotic systems. The hierarchical control scheme has three levels: learning level, skill level and adaptation level. The learning level manipulates symbols to reason logically for control strategies. The skill level produces control references along with the control strategies and sensory information on environments. The adaptation level controls robots and machines while adapting to their environments which include uncertainties. For these levels and to connect them, artificial intelligence, neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms are applied to the hierarchical control system while integrating and synthesizing themselves. To be intelligent, the hierarchical control system learns various experiences both in a top-down manner and a bottom-up manner. The reinforcement learning is very important for acquisition of the control signal without any previous information of the system or environment. The group behavior control scheme which is one of the artificial life research areas, and the network robot control scheme are also very important for multiple robotic systems. Thus, these control schemes are effective for intelligent robotics.;"Neuro-fuzzy system; genetic algorithm; hierarchical control; group robots; network robots";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Experimental Advanced Instructional Design Advisor (XAIDA), a simple ITS shell, was evaluated in a study of 17 Air Force medical-technician trainers. The study examined XAIDA’s learnability, usability, and acceptability to the participants using a one-week combined training and evaluation program. All participants were able to produce courseware using XAIDA. Measures of cognitive structure indicated that their conception of XAIDA’s features became more similar to that of an expert as the result of training. Performance tests, skill ratings and usability ratings indicated that XAIDA is both usable and learnable. Participant’s attitudes were generally positive except at a point when training required a difficult cognitive shift. Attitudes remained focused througout training on personal and low-level concerns, indicating the participants were not likely to be early adapters of the technology.

Part 2: LMI — An improved interface;1997;The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology;The STL (STereoLithography) file format, as developed by 3D Systems, has been widely used by most Rapid Prototyping (RP) systems and is supported by all major computer-aided design (CAD) systems. However, it is necessary to improve the STL format to meet the development needs of RP technologies. In Part 1, several existing and proposed formats have been discussed. This paper, Part 2, will present an improved interface between CAD and RP systems. The new interface is a file format that supports the STL format, removes redundant information in the STL format and adds topological information to balance storage and processing cost. In addition to supporting facet boundary models, the new interface supports precise models by using the edge-based boundary representation. This paper discusses the design considerations of the new interface and data structures for both facet models and precise models. Finally, a comparison of the new interface and the STL file format will be made.;"Computer-aided design (CAD); Computer-aided manufacture (CAM); Data exchange; Rapid prototyping; STL (STereoLithography) format";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
474;;10.1023/A:1018742004992;Springer;;;;;Roles have been widely used for modeling theauthority, responsibility, functions, and interactions,associated with manager positions within organizations.In this paper, we discuss the issues related tospecifying roles for both human and automated managersof distributed computer systems. The starting point isthat a role can be defined in terms of the authorizationand obligation policies, for a particular managerposition, which specify what actions the manager ispermitted or is obliged to do on a set of targetobjects. This permits individuals to be assigned orremoved from positions without respecifying the policiesfor the role. However these policies are insufficientfor fully specifying relationships between managers andthe targets they manage or between different managerroles. There is a need to specify the interactionprotocols and how managers coordinate and synchronizetheir activities. The role-based framework consists ofa set of tools enabling the creation of roles frompolicies, the specification of the concurrencyconstraints for role activities and the specification ofprotocols for role interaction. In addition, the issuesrelated to conflicts which can occur between policieswithin a role or between interacting roles are brieflydiscussed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Such weaknesses may either introduce undetected system weaknesses, or otherwise significant costs may arise in their correction later in the development process. Typically, the RE process contains a number of individual and group activities and thus is particularly subject to weaknesses arising from human factors. Our work has concerned the development of PERE (Process Evaluation in Requirements Engineering), which is a structured method for analysing processes for weaknesses and proposing process improvements against them. PERE combines two complementary viewpoints within its process evaluation approach. Firstly, a classical engineering analysis is used for process modelling and generic process weakness identification. This initial analysis is fed into the second analysis phase, in which those process components that are primarily composed of human activity, their interconnections and organisational context are subject to a systematic human factors analysis. In this paper we briefly describe PERE and provide examples of the application experience to date.;"Human Factor; Requirement Engineering; Process Improvement; Requirement Engineer; Fault Tree Analysis";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
476;A hierarchical model of agent based on skill, rules, and knowledge;10.1007/3-540-61291-2_52;Springer;Chaib-draa, B.;A hierarchical model of agent based on skill, rules, and knowledge;1996;Advances in Artifical Intelligence;The principal aim of this research is to structure agents according to different situations that have to deal with. To achieve this, we propose a conceptual model with a hierarchical structure defined by the skill-rule-knowledge ( S — R — K ) levels. At the skill level, the agent deals with routines and her behavior is governed by stored patterns of predefined procedures, that map directly an observation (i.e. perception) to an action. The rule-based level represents more conscious behavior and it deals with familiar situations. This behavior is generally conventionally described by a set of heuristics. Finally, the knowledge-based level accounts for unfamiliar situations for which know-how or rules are not available. An implementation of this model has been done in the context of a multiagent environment to confirm our mean expectation: the perceptual processing (i.e., S and R levels) is fast, effortless and is propitious for coordinated activities between agents , whereas the analytical problem solving (i.e., K level) is slow, laborious and can lead to conflicts between agents.;"Multiagent System; Perception Module; Agent Architecture; Causal Belief; Execution Module";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
477;Orthogonally persistent object systems;10.1007/BF01231642;Springer;"Atkinson, Malcolm; Morrison, Ronald";Orthogonally persistent object systems;1995;The VLDB Journal;Persistent Application Systems (PASs) are of increasing social and economic importance. They have the potential to be long-lived, concurrently accessed, and consist of large bodies of data and programs. Typical examples of PASs are CAD/CAM systems, office automation, CASE tools, software engineering environments, and patient-care support systems in hospitals. Orthogonally persistent object systems are intended to provide improved support for the design, construction, maintenance, and operation of PASs. Persistence abstraction allows the creation and manipulation of data in a manner, that is independent of its lifetime, thereby integrating the database view of information with the programming language view. This yields a number of advantages in terms of orthogonal design and programmer productivity which are beneficial for PASs. Design principles have been proposed for persistent systems. By following these principles, languages that provide persistence as a basic abstraction have been developed. In this paper, the motivation for orthogonal persistence is reviewed along with the above mentioned design principles. The concepts for integrating programming languages and databases through the persistence abstraction, and their benefits, are given. The technology to support persistence, the achievements, and future directions of persistence research are then discussed.;"Orthogonal persistence; persistent programming languages; database programming languages; persistent application systems";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This domain is an example of distributed supervisory control, where a team of human operators supervises a dynamic, complex, highly automated system. Such operational environments differ in important ways from artifact-centered collaboration (e.g., collaborative drawing, writing, design).

The project was concerned with simulation based training in industrial environments. In such situations, models are required not only of the technical systems being manipulated, but also of the operational expertise required to carry out tasks. Now the way something should be modelled is dependent on the context in which the model will be used — this is true whatever the nature of the model: mental, numerical, or otherwise. Consequently, multiple models are required along with a framework which allows their effective use. A number of modelling tools are described and related to a classification of models.

The first approach is to build a persistent store which operates above a conventional operating system such as Unix. Examples include PS-algol [1], Napier88 [9], E [10], etc. This approach has the advantage that existing tools and facilities can be used to assist with the development and maintenance of the persistent system. However, it has the disadvantage that the interface provided by conventional operating systems is often inappropriate for supporting persistence and it may not provide enough control over the hardware support for memory management.

Generic models for large-scale three-dimensional components are difficult to build. The difficulties result from the lack of robust automatic mesh generation and the availability of a parametric model. To remedy this problem, a basis function concept used in mathematics for representing an arbitrary function is employed for geometric representation of solids. This approach does not require automatic mesh generation or parametric models for geometric representation and thus is suitable for large-scale complicated components.

This paper examines a number of issues surrounding the support of cooperative applications and how they impact both CSCW and computer science research. In particular, the relationship between cooperative applications and the supporting techniques of distributed systems and database technology are investigated. Cooperative applications question many of the design assumptions embodied within these techniques, and ask far reaching questions of the technology. Traditionally, support systems have been unaware of cooperative activities and have hidden the actions of others from each user. This paper examines the implications of this choice and the need to consider alternative approaches to the provision of systems support.

This is because most intelligent tutoring systems are restricted to working in a tightly constrained domain, and thus have little need for subject organization at the macro level of curriculum. Nevertheless, there is a small, but interesting, line of research in ITS that has explored issues of direct concern to curriculum. This research has led to the idea of curriculum as an emergent phenomenon, created dynamically in response to student needs, to requirements of the subject matter, and to pedagogical goals. Such a curriculum is adaptable to a changing environment, flexible in instructional goals, and individualized to the student. This paper traces the evolution of the notion of curriculum in intelligent tutoring systems, in order to show how and why the current idea of curriculum came about, and to demonstrate its power. Along the way, particular systems are used to illustrate interesting aspects of ITS curriculum and to give concrete foundation to the discussion.;"intelligent tutoring systems; curriculum; instructional planning";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper the authors propose to use the framework of an object-oriented knowledge base as the basis to, organise the knowledge in an automatic manufacturing environment. Such systems can provide significant advantages in terms of knowledge management, integrity control, object abstraction, design abstraction, and very high level programming. The power of this framework is illustrated in detail in the context of process planning, which is one of the major components of an automatic manufacturing environment.;"Integrity Constraint; Advance Manufacture Technology; Facility Layout; Robot Programming; Process Planning System";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Taking the developments in the machine building sector in Germany as an example, it becomes apparent that a human-centred approach (skill-based manufacturing) offers the companies many advantages over Tayloristic forms of work organisation and automation. Closer observations reveal that skills and qualifications based on empirical knowledge and individual capabilities, such as a feeling for machines and materials, continue to play an important part in the work with computer-controlled machines. So far, however, skills of this kind have received neither practical nor systematic consideration and are regarded as tacit skills in most cases. Therefore it is particularly the use of computer technology which is likely — in most cases unintentionally — to restrict and undermine the essential preconditions necessary for the development and application of such skills.;"skill-based manufacturing; human-centred manufacturing; empirical knowledge; sensorial perception; computer-based manufacturing";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For the last eight years the Distributed Systems Research Group at Imperial College has conducted research into the development of an environment to support the construction and operation of distributed software. The result has been the Conic Toolkit: a comprehensive set of language and run-time tools for program compilation, building, debugging and execution in a distributed environment. Programs may be run on a set of interconnected host computers running the Unix™ operating system and/or on target machines with no resident operating system. Two languages are provided, one for programming individual task modules (processes) and one for the configuration of programs from groups of task modules. In addition the environment supports the reuse of program components and allows the configuration of new components into running systems. This dynamic configuration capability is provided by a distributed configuration management tool which is the primary method of creating, controlling and modifying distributed application programs. This paper describes the main features of the Conic toolkit and illustrates the facilities provided using a simple example.;"distributed programming; configuration; host/target environment; dynamic configuration";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

After introducing transaction processing, the paper presents models describing the structure of distributed systems, the transactional computations on them, and the layered software architecture that supports those computations. The software architecture model contains five layers, including an intermediate layer that provides a common set of useful functions for supporting the highly reliable operation of system services, such as data management, file management, and mail. The functions of this layer can be realized in what is termed a distributed transaction facility . The paper then describes one such facility — Camelot. Camelot provides flexible and high performance commit supervision, disk management, and recovery mechanisms that are useful for implementing a wide class of abstract data types, including large databases. It runs on the Unix-compatible Mach operating system and uses the standard Arpanet IP communication protocols. Presently, Camelot runs on RT PC’s and Vaxes, but it should also run on other computers including shared-memory multiprocessors.;"Processing Node; Transaction Processing; Transaction Management; Deadlock Detection; Operating System Kernel";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

At the same time, as the relevance of a system approach to the problem of dependability had already been perceived, research work was being started in the academic world in the error detecting and correcting codes fields, and in complex system diagnosis. These studies greatly benefitted from the strong mathematical background of the researchers initially involved. This work was considerably developed during the seventies, following the technological evolution. The difficulties involved in generating tests with high coverage determined the need to embed features for easy testability and diagnosability into system design. The architectural evolution from uniprocessor to multiple processor systems, either in tightly coupled or in loosely coupled configurations, together with the medium term industrial interest in promoting prototyping efforts, particularly in the industrial process control and on-line transaction processing fields, have produced a wide range of studies covering all system aspects (physical configuration, operating systems, programming languages and environments).

This research seeks to develop CC architecture design methods. As a basis, a unified library of elementary functions is designed to enable creation of CCs. With a focus on enabling dynamic CC composition and skill generation, we aim to provide a systematic and scalable approach to flexibility in control applications. The primary objective is to establish a proof of concept for the proposed function library, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness via validating various procedures. Through the combination of a conceptual framework and prac-tical implementations, this paper validates the potential impact of a unified, composable CCs in enhancing adaptability and re-sponsiveness within control applications in industrial production. Furthermore, the machine-readable functionality description of CCs enhances their reusability and adaptability and thus increase the flexibility and efficiency of production processes.

512;Unequal-area capability-based facility layout design problem with a heuristic decomposition-based iterative mathematical programming approach;10.1016/j.eswa.2022.119199;Scopus;"Subulan, K.; Varol, B.; Baykasoğlu, A.";Unequal-area capability-based facility layout design problem with a heuristic decomposition-based iterative mathematical programming approach;2023;Expert Systems with Applications;Thus far in the available literature, capability-based facility layout design approaches were developed by only considering equal machine areas, where they are assigned to the pre-specified locations. Based on this motivation, this paper introduces a new unequal-area capability-based facility layout design (UA-CBFLD) problem for the first time in the literature. In addition to the machines’ unequal-area requirements, the proper distribution of their processing capabilities over the shop floor is considered. First, a new mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is developed. Then, a polyhedral inner-approximation method is applied to cope with non-linear area constraints. Due to its NP-hard nature and highly non-linear structure, a heuristic decomposition-based iterative solution approach is also proposed to solve realistic size problems within a reasonable time. In order to show the validity and applicability of the proposed approach, both an illustrative example with different machine-capability overlaps and a real-life application in a manufacturing company are presented. The computational results have shown that the proposed approach has found a 33.25% better layout score (as a function of the distance and the amounts of product flows) and achieved this solution 116.64% faster than the solution of the developed MINLP model via Gurobi's standard non-linear programming solver. Furthermore, when compared to the existing cellular facility layout design of the manufacturing company, the proposed capability-based unequal-area layout design option has also 29.37% and 34.74% superior layout scores under the scenarios of equal and unequal machine areas, respectively. Moreover, the total average machine utilization has increased up to 89.6%, which is comparatively better than the current average cell utilization, i.e., 65.2%. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd;"Approximation methods; Approximation theory; Capability-based layout design; Design problems; Facilities layout design; Heuristic decomposition; Heuristic decomposition-based approach; Heuristic methods; Inner-approximation method; Integer programming; Iterative methods; Layout designs; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Mixed-integer non-linear programming; Nonlinear programming; Plant layout; UA-FLP";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

514;A Novel Robust Imitation Learning Framework for Complex Skills with Limited Demonstrations;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10539010;Scopus;"Wang, W.; Zeng, C.; Zhan, H.; Yang, C.";A Novel Robust Imitation Learning Framework for Complex Skills with Limited Demonstrations;2025;IEEE Trans. Automat. Sci. Eng. (IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering);Imitation learning allows us to directly encode manipulation skills based on human demonstrations, facilitating rapid transfer of skills without any expert knowledge. Autonomous dynamic systems (DS) offer reliable stability and time-independence though sacrificing part of accuracy, and are increasingly attractive as an encoding method. As unstructured environments become more challenging, skill trajectories become more complex, and various disturbances are encountered, existing state-of-the-art encoding methods struggle to adapt to these complex tasks. This paper introduces a novel robust DS-based framework for learning skills in complex tasks, which consists of trajectory regularization, adaptive segmentation, skill modeling, and skill organization based on new task requirements. It achieves a task-level generalization so that the operator only needs to focus on the semantic deconstruction of a task. Additionally, we propose an online modulation policy for the skill decision engine to address two types of disturbances: enhancing convergence speed for large-scale disturbances and improving fitting capability for small-scale disturbances while still keeping stability. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conduct various comparison experiments in simulation and a real-world sugar-scooping task to assess the generalization performance and the ability of resistance to disturbances. Note to Practitioners - Imitation learning for complex tasks is crucial to the development of robot intelligence. However, achieving a balance between maintaining generalization accuracy and robustness remains a challenging problem that necessitates continuous exploration in the field of imitation learning. The purpose of this paper is to propose a robust imitation learning framework from human demonstration, which includes preprocessing, learning and generalization, that can be applied in industrial production or daily life. Considering appropriate trajectory segmentation and self-organization strategies can effectively improve the generalization accuracy by prior research, it is necessary to introduce them into our framework. Most importantly, we design novel disturbance-resistant online modulation strategies from both task-level and motion-level aspects. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulations and coffee scooping experiments. The results show that skills acquired through demonstration can reliably, accurately, and safely perform tasks even in uncertain environments. This paper is a systematic and pioneering attempt to implement. © 2024 IEEE.;"Complex task; Demonstrations; dynamic system; Encoding (symbols); Encoding methods; Expert knowledge; Generalisation; Generalization accuracy; Human demonstrations; Imitation learning; Intelligent robots; Learning frameworks; Motion skill library; motion skills library; Semantics; Signal encoding; Task levels; Trajectories";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, nowadays various PLC vendors use different dialects of the standardized programming languages in their tools, which hinders the re-usability and interoperability across the platforms. The service-oriented approaches can serve to overcome interoperability issues. In distributed control systems, the functionality of an automation component can be offered to the other parties that constitute a production system via a standardized interface, easing the orchestration of the whole system. This paper proposes such a generic interface that hides away the low-level implementation details of a particular functionality and provides a common semantic model for the execution. Further, we show how using such an interface can help to support and automate the overall engineering process, combining the functionality of different components to fulfill a production task. The reference implementation of the proposed concept was used in an industrial demonstrator, which shows the benefits in the system flexibility due to components interoperability and re-usability compared to the traditional control approaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SIoT is a new paradigm where IoT merges with social networks, allowing people and connected devices as well as the devices themselves to interact within a social network framework. Through an online survey with 60 potential users, we identified eight desired features for the SIoT, which were then clustered into four rule categories that can be programmed by end users and/or imposed by systems. The rules created by end users are used to reason about both devices and people in their social relationships to support automated decisions during runtime. Socialite uses ontology/semantic models for basic/low-level knowledge representation (e.g., device and user) to encapsulate the heterogeneity in devices from various manufacturers, and uses production rules (trigger-action programming) for high-level reasoning. With the ontology model, our reasoning supports both device type automation (e.g., current temperature from a thermostat) and capability-based automation (e.g., current temperature from any devices with the same capability). Furthermore, the Socialite rules leverage social relationships and device capabilities to facilitate collaboration by efficiently sharing configuration and information among users/friends and even with devices from people unknown to a user. In a 24-participant user study (12 with no programming experience), we found that Socialite was easy to learn and use, for both programmers and non-programmers. Participants were able to create automation based rules, social relationship involved rules, as well rules they created during the study.;"End User Programming; Semantic Reasoning Framework; Social Internet of Things";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This research aims to reduce the need for extensive domain knowledge, streamline system development, and thereby make the implementation of intelligent cobots more affordable for high-mix low-volume applications.

Technol. Work;Based on previous studies on programming errors and their causes, the presented paper investigates errors that application engineers in the area of machine and plant automation make while creating either function block diagrams, plcML [an adaption of the unified modelling language (UML)] or modAT4rMS code (a newly developed modelling language that adapts and combines aspects of UML and SysML). A laboratory-based study with 52 mechatronics apprentices and electrical engineering technicians with knowhow in manufacturing system design but comparably undeveloped programming skills has been conducted, in which the subjects’ errors and think-aloud statements during code creation were recorded. In a subsequent step, these data have been analysed by the cognitive causes of the coding errors applying the skill-rules-knowledge framework. As a result, a taxonomy of errors is presented. Results indicate that most of the errors in the subjects’ code are due to insufficient understanding of the notation’s syntax, problems with the rules of encapsulation, the creation of modules and finally with the creation of variants and aggregations, which are all located at the rule-based level. Errors at the skill-based level mainly occurred during behavioural modelling with modAT4rMS. It is argued that the provided insights can be used for improving education on programmable logic controller (PLC) languages and for the design of tools that support PLC programmers at detecting and fixing errors within their code.;"Automation; Errors; human factors; Object-oriented methods; Software engineering";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Considering workers as the second important resources in Dual-Resource Constraint (DRC) settings makes this problem more serious and critical to research because, in reality, jobs cannot be processed if workers, machines, or both are not available. This paper attempts to form CBVCMSs with DRC settings using a multi-objective mathematical model with a Goal Programming (GP) approach. Using the developed model, parts, machines, and workers are grouped and assigned to the generated virtual cells at the same time. The proposed model is solved through a multi-objective Tabu Search (TS) algorithm to find optimum or near-to-optimum solutions. The validity of the developed model is illustrated by two numerical examples taken from the literature and evaluated through comparing the performance of the CBVCMSs and the original classical CMSs in the System Capacity Utilization (SCU) point of view.;"Capability-based virtual cellular manufacturing systems; Dual-resource constrained setting; Goal programming; Group technology; Resource elements; Tabu Search";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, nowadays various PLC vendors use different dialects of the standardized programming languages in their tools, which hinders the re-usability and interoperability across the platforms. The service-oriented approaches can serve to overcome interoperability issues. In distributed control systems, the functionality of an automation component can be offered to the other parties that constitute a production system via a standardized interface, easing the orchestration of the whole system. This paper proposes such a generic interface that hides away the low-level implementation details of a particular functionality and provides a common semantic model for the execution. Further, we show how using such an interface can help to support and automate the overall engineering process, combining the functionality of different components to fulfill a production task. The reference implementation of the proposed concept was used in an industrial demonstrator, which shows the benefits in the system flexibility due to components interoperability and re-usability compared to the traditional control approaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Soft Comput.;The construction of knowledge graph is beneficial for grid production, electrical safety protection, fault diagnosis and traceability in an observable and controllable way. Highly-precision text classification algorithm is crucial to build a professional knowledge graph in power system. Unfortunately, there are a large number of poorly described and specialized texts in the power business system, and the amount of data containing valid labels in these texts is low. This will bring great challenges to improve the precision of text classification models. To offset the gap, we propose a classification algorithm for Chinese text in the power system based on deep active learning (CCTP-DAL). Our core idea is to apply a hierarchical confidence strategy to a deep active learning model, to balance the trade-offs between the amount of training data and the accuracy of text classification. Our CCTP-DAL (1) trains the Bert model using a small amount of labeled data to calculate the confidence level of each short text, (2) selects high-confidence text data with optimal model generalization capability based on the hierarchical confidence level, and (3) fuses deep learning models and active learning strategies to ensure high text classification accuracy with less labeled training data. We benchmark our model on a real crawler data on the web with extensive experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model can achieve higher text classification accuracy with less labeled training data compared with other deep learning models.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This process begins with evaluating machine tool capabilities to handle specific part geometries and microstructures. Once a match is established, the focus shifts to developing an efficient method for converting design elements into physical components. This work aims to create and validate a framework that assesses the manufacturability of design features based on the available machinery and materials. Specifically, it involves classifying manufacturing processes, such as turning and milling, for a given part design geometry. To achieve this, feature attributes like rotational symmetry and D2 distribution are calculated for a dataset used to train a decision tree. This model then suggests the appropriate manufacturing process for a given CAD model. The decision tree is validated with a separate dataset, showing reasonable accuracy. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance process planning, ensuring the seamless translation of designs into physical products, with a particular emphasis on geometry, microstructure, and cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Skill-based approaches allow for flexible production setups, with capabilities used to align product requirements with machine capabilities to create suitable production plans. However, accurate simulations of these plans require precise input data, specifically the actual state of the product, necessitating the use of detailed 3D models rather than simple bounding boxes. This research demonstrates how the concept of IPWs, commonly used in CAM-based manufacturing, can be adapted for skill-based production. IPWs facilitate the tracking and transfer of the current state of the workpiece throughout various machining skills, ensuring accurate feasibility checks and error-free execution. The proposed method leverages the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) to manage and exchange data, including IPWs, across different stages of production. A prototype implementation illustrates the feasibility of this approach, highlighting its potential to enhance the accuracy and reliability of production processes. The findings indicate that while the integration of IPWs is promising, further research is needed to address challenges related to collision simulations and the embedding of additional intelligent manufacturing functionalities. Future work will focus on refning the architecture of manufacturing skills and expanding the scope of IPW applications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
529;Designing robust capability-based distributed machine layouts with random machine availability and fuzzy demand/process flow information;10.1007/s00500-023-08756-y;Springer-Verlag, ACM Digital Library Guide to Computing Literature;"Subulan, Kemal; Varol, Bilge; Baykasoğlu, Adil";Designing robust capability-based distributed machine layouts with random machine availability and fuzzy demand/process flow information;2024;Soft Comput (Soft Computing);Thus far in the available literature, capability-based distributed layout (CBDL) design approaches were only developed under certain environments. Indeed, uncertainties embedded in the machine unavailability (or random machine breakdowns), product demands, and process flow data were not considered by the previous studies to achieve a robust CBDL design. However, many real-life facility layout design applications may involve different types of uncertainties simultaneously, like fuzziness and stochasticity. Based on this motivation, for the first time in the literature, this paper introduces a novel robust capability-based distributed layout (R-CBDL) design problem under a mixed fuzzy-stochastic environment. First, a new fuzzy-stochastic optimization model of the R-CBDL design problem is developed by considering the random machine breakdowns and fuzzy demand/process flow data. Then, a hybrid solution approach based on a chance-constrained stochastic programming technique with a well-known interactive fuzzy resolution method is proposed. Thus, the random machine breakdowns and fuzzy part flow rates among different machining capabilities could be easily handled via the proposed approach. Fortunately, the proposed approach can also generate various risky and risk-free robust layout design alternatives under different probabilistic scenarios and uncertainty levels (α-cuts) according to the facility designer’s risk attitude. To show the validity and applicability of the proposed R-CBDL problem and hybrid solution approach, an extensive computational study with comparative analysis is first presented based on an illustrative numerical example under different machine capability overlap cases and probability distributions. Then, the performance of the proposed approach is also tested on a real-life cellular manufacturing system of a company. The computational experiments have shown that the proposed approach can accomplish more efficient robust layout design alternatives with on average 24.5% better total expected layout score when compared to the existing cellular layout of the manufacturing company.;"Chance-constrained stochastic program; Fuzzy mathematical programming; Fuzzy part flows; Random machine availability; Robust capability-based distributed layout problem";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Based on this motivation, this paper introduces a new unequal-area capability-based facility layout design (UA-CBFLD) problem for the first time in the literature. In addition to the machines’ unequal-area requirements, the proper distribution of their processing capabilities over the shop floor is considered. First, a new mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is developed. Then, a polyhedral inner-approximation method is applied to cope with non-linear area constraints. Due to its NP-hard nature and highly non-linear structure, a heuristic decomposition-based iterative solution approach is also proposed to solve realistic size problems within a reasonable time. In order to show the validity and applicability of the proposed approach, both an illustrative example with different machine-capability overlaps and a real-life application in a manufacturing company are presented. The computational results have shown that the proposed approach has found a 33.25% better layout score (as a function of the distance and the amounts of product flows) and achieved this solution 116.64% faster than the solution of the developed MINLP model via Gurobi’s standard non-linear programming solver. Furthermore, when compared to the existing cellular facility layout design of the manufacturing company, the proposed capability-based unequal-area layout design option has also 29.37% and 34.74% superior layout scores under the scenarios of equal and unequal machine areas, respectively. Moreover, the total average machine utilization has increased up to 89.6%, which is comparatively better than the current average cell utilization, i.e., 65.2%.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SIoT is a new paradigm where IoT merges with social networks, allowing people and connected devices as well as the devices themselves to interact within a social network framework. Through an online survey with 60 potential users, we identified eight desired features for the SIoT, which were then clustered into four rule categories that can be programmed by end users and/or imposed by systems. The rules created by end users are used to reason about both devices and people in their social relationships to support automated decisions during runtime. Socialite uses ontology/semantic models for basic/low-level knowledge representation (e.g., device and user) to encapsulate the heterogeneity in devices from various manufacturers, and uses production rules (trigger-action programming) for high-level reasoning. With the ontology model, our reasoning supports both device type automation (e.g., current temperature from a thermostat) and capability-based automation (e.g., current temperature from any devices with the same capability). Furthermore, the Socialite rules leverage social relationships and device capabilities to facilitate collaboration by efficiently sharing configuration and information among users/friends and even with devices from people unknown to a user. In a 24-participant user study (12 with no programming experience), we found that Socialite was easy to learn and use, for both programmers and non-programmers. Participants were able to create automation based rules, social relationship involved rules, as well rules they created during the study.;"End User Programming; Semantic Reasoning Framework; Social Internet of Things";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To combine the advantages of mass production such as economies of scale and the requirements of customization, modularity has proven to be a solution. However, production systems stay focused on specific products, thus are difficult to adapt to new product variants and changes on the shop floor. In order to ensure the subsequent adaptability of production plants, the paradigm of service-oriented architecture allows to instantiate flexible Cyber-Physical Production Modules (CPPM) which offer their capabilities as services.

A robot operation is created on-line by parameterizing and connecting robot skills. The on-line interface is iconic, with each icon representing a single skill or a complex icon that represents an abstraction of two or more skill icons. The objective of modeling robot operations as a sequence of skills is to reduce the cost of programming robot systems. This is achieved by separating the programming responsibilities of the application specialist and the systems programmer. The application specialist who works on the shop floor is able to create robot programs without being concerned with the low level programming to control sensors and devices. A computational paradigm for creating and maintaining the robot skills is presented. This is the underlying software architecture which enables the creation of a shop floor interface. It is an object-based paradigm designed for the abstraction of the low level functions of the sensors and machine controllers. The skills are defined as template objects with a list of attributes to completely specify a sensor-based robot action.

Kruger";Extended behavior trees for quick definition of flexible robotic tasks;2017;2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS);The requirement of flexibility in the modern industries demands robots that can be efficiently and quickly adapted to different tasks. A way to achieve such a flexible programming paradigm is to instruct robots with task goals and leave planning algorithms to deduct the correct sequence of actions to use in the specific context. A common approach is to connect the skills that realize a semantically defined operation in the planning domain - such as picking or placing an object - to specific executable functions. As a result the skills are treated as independent components, which results into suboptimal execution. In this paper we present an approach where the execution procedures and the planning domain are specified at the same time using solely extended Behavior Trees (eBT), a model formalized and discussed in this paper. At run-time, the robot can use the more abstract skills to plan a sequence using a PDDL planner, expand the sequence into a hierarchical tree, and re-organize it to optimize the time of execution and the use of resources. The optimization is demonstrated on a kitting operation in both simulation and lab environment, showing up to 20% save in the final execution time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, the authors extend the well-known division of production entities into product, process, and resource (PPR) with a skill definition. There are two main advantages for this approach: First, using PPR for the skill definition allows easy integration into existing models and tools. Second, there is a natural tendency to define very generic skills to capture all possible use cases. But at some point, skills have to be translated into precise instructions for execution. The model makes this dichotomy explicit and provides a common taxonomy for stakeholders concerned with skills on different abstraction levels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Accordingly, we propose a four dimensional classification scheme for skills, and assess the suitability of a property model and OWL ontologies to describe and match skills. For each case, we identify a list of challenges that must be addressed to make skill-based engineering a reality in industrial automation systems.

Moreover, decreasing product lifecycles pose a real challenge to traditional production. To address this, new developments are required that provide highly adaptable and quickly deployable systems, and can be reusable across different products in order to distribute its cost. This motivated the introduction of Evolvable Assembly Systems concept. The introduction of this approach provides new challenges but also opportunities for current modular assembly system configuration methods. This paper reports on a new skilled based configuration methodology for evolvable mechatronic systems, which uses a process focused semantic model, as basis for assembly system configuration. The paper covers physical configuration and process configuration aspects, while highlighting the operation of the overall mechatronic system. The paper provide also a preliminary demonstration of developed tools that implement the described methodology, which highlights the potential of this approach in significantly reducing the system configuration and control deployment effort for agent-based mechatronic systems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The language offers three different level of abstraction for robot programming. On lowest level skills are coded by domain experts. On a more abstract level these skills are supposed to be combined by shop floor workers or technicians to define tasks. The language is designed to allow as much flexibility as necessary on the lowest level of abstraction and is kept as simple as possible with the more abstract layers. A Statechart like model is used to describe the different levels of detail. For this we apply the UML/P and the language workbench MontiCore. To this end we are able to generate code while hiding controller specific implementation details.

Madsen";Robot skills for manufacturing: From concept to industrial deployment;2016;Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing;Due to a general shift in manufacturing paradigm from mass production towards mass customization, reconfigurable automation technologies, such as robots, are required. However, current industrial robot solutions are notoriously difficult to program, leading to high changeover times when new products are introduced by manufacturers. In order to compete on global markets, the factories of tomorrow need complete production lines, including automation technologies that can effortlessly be reconfigured or repurposed, when the need arises. In this paper we present the concept of general, self-asserting robot skills for manufacturing. We show how a relatively small set of skills are derived from current factory worker instructions, and how these can be transferred to industrial mobile manipulators. General robot skills can not only be implemented on these robots, but also be intuitively concatenated to program the robots to perform a variety of tasks, through the use of simple task-level programming methods. We demonstrate various approaches to this, extensively tested with several people inexperienced in robotics. We validate our findings through several deployments of the complete robot system in running production facilities at an industrial partner. It follows from these experiments that the use of robot skills, and associated task-level programming framework, is a viable solution to introducing robots that can intuitively and on the fly be programmed to perform new tasks by factory workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For upcoming new generations of even more flexible robot solutions, in applications such as dexterous assembly, the robot setup and programming gets even more challenging. Reuse of solutions in terms of parameters, controls, process tuning, and of software modules in general then gets increasingly important. There has been valuable progress within reuse of automation solutions when machines comply with standards and behave according to nominal models. However, more flexible robots with sensor-based manipulation skills and cognitive functions for human interaction are far too complex to manage, and solutions are rarely reusable since knowledge is either implicit in imperative software or not captured in machine readable form.

This is relevant for building a new production line as well as for faster reconfiguration when adding new hardware and product variants to an existing manufacturing line. This paper identifies operational requirements for such reconfiguration scenarios and proposes a way to implement them using the concept of a device adapter.

This allows not only to detect the changes in the hardware, which appear in the production system, using the device discovery mechanisms but also automatically adapt the software. Preliminary tests have been performed on a demonstrator that shows both virtual and physical executions combined in a single system.

Starting from low-level demonstrations of assembly tasks, the system is able to extract a high-level relational plan of the task. A graphical user interface (GUI) allows then the user to iteratively correct the acquired knowledge by refining high-level plans, and low-level geometrical knowledge of the task. This combination leads to a faster programming phase, more precise than just demonstrations, and more intuitive than just through a GUI. A final process allows to reuse high-level task knowledge for similar tasks in a transfer learning fashion.

However, the implementation the trending Cyber Physical Systems concepts via ‘Plug-and-Produce’ devices produces some communication overheads. In this direction, the openMOS project aims to decouple the elements that are responsible for adaptation and general operations of the system. This allows the system to have two parallel processes. Towards this end, the priority is to deliver high performance process executions, while the other process focuses on delivering the required agility. The focus of this work is narrowed down to the development of task execution tables that guarantees high performance process executions. In this direction, the definition of task execution table is based on an existing AutomationML (AML) model that highlights the explicit relationships between the Product, Process and Resource (PPR) domains. A new decisional attribute has been added to the existing ‘Skill’ concept, which provides the flexibility to incorporate eventbased process alternatives.

Such tools need to be supported by formal information models describing the product requirements, as well as resource characteristics and functionalities. This paper concentrates on introducing the formal resource and capability models, which are used and further enriched to support ReCaM targets. Also examples of how these models can be applied to support rapid reconfiguration will be given.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Rosado";An ontology for integrated machining and inspection process planning focusing on resource capabilities;2015;International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing;The search for and assignment of resources is extremely important for the efficient planning of any process in a distributed environment, such as the collaborative product integrated development process. These environments require a degree of semantic interoperability, which currently can only be provided by ontological models. However, the ontological proposals centred on Resources for Machining and Inspection Process Planning have a limited reach, do not adopt a unified view of machining and inspection, and fail to express knowledge in the manner required by some of the planning tasks, as is the case with those concerned with resource assignment and plan validation. With the aim of providing a solution to these shortcomings the manufacturing and inspection resource capability (MIRC) ontology has been developed, as a specialist offshoot of the product and processes development resources capability ontology. This ontology considers resource capabilities to be a characteristic of the resource executing any activity present in an integrated process plan. Special attention is given to resource preparation activities, due to their influence on the quality of the final product. After describing the MIRC ontology, a case study demonstrates how the ontology supports the process planning for any level, approach or plan strategy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Šormaz";Ontology Model for Process Level Capabilities of Manufacturing Resources;2019;Procedia Manufacturing;The promise of distributed cloud manufacturing (CM) is to manufacture products using shared resources, both asset-full (machines, tools, vehicles) and asset-light (design, analysis, inspection, management, maintenance), which can be provisioned flexibly and rapidly with minimal management and service provider interaction. One of the key enabler of CM are virtual enterprises (VE), which offer manufacturing resources as virtual services (SaaS, HaaS, PaaS) in a cloud based marketplace. Currently, virtualization and provisioning of diverse array of manufacturing resources face challenges from the heterogeneity in representation and communication protocols, as well as lack of integration with legacy practices in the organizations. Aiming to increase interoperability, a number of formal ontologies were developed by researchers in the past, to leverage on semantic data integration and validation. In spite of their success in providing axiomatic description and common taxonomy to classify manufacturing resources from different domains, models of representing the capabilities of the resources (i.e. expected quality of services they offer) were often overlooked. In this research, we present an ontology model to represent capabilities of manufacturing machine-tools at the process level, often called process boundaries (measured by process capability index) in industries. The definition of the capability is derived based on the foundational ontology called ‘Basic Formal Ontology’ (BFO). The primary contribution of this extension is a set of OWL axioms which can be used to assert facts about modal future (possibilia) – ultimately enabling us to associate process specific performance metrics to the semantic models of virtual machine-tools.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Ruskowski";A CAD feature-based manufacturing approach with OPC UA skills;2020;Procedia Manufacturing;One of the biggest obstacles on the path to digitalization in an industrial environment is the lack of communication standards. This is particularly evident where several domains meet. In this case, conventional machine tools, robotics and computer vision have to interact over a common interface. We propose a structure based on OPC UA, which unifies the procedure of programming for the human operator, regardless of whether the task is performed by a robot or a machine tool in the end. The idea is to use OPC UA skills for the manufacturing of components, that consist of common standard geometric features such as holes or pockets. Our approach enables the translation of required manufacturing parameters directly from a CAD model to OPC UA skills instead of using CAM. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate suitable CAD interfaces as well as enabling an autonomous implementation of the process on a manufacturing system. From this approach, the definition of an OPC UA Companion Specification for manufacturing processes could be derived. The implementation of the concept is carried out on a flexible robot cell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

FeasibilityCheck, PreconditionCheck and SkillExecution have emerged as important basic components of complex manufacturing skills in order to be able to control skills usefully and efficiently, especially for machine tools. This paper describes the roles of each basic skill component in machining skills and shows how they can be used. Furthermore, the concept of IDs for referencing already given ParameterSets is evaluated for machining skills. A prototype implementation shows how these ParameterSetIDs can be used to efficiently interact with the basic skill components. The results show the fundamental sense of this separation of FeasibilityCheck, PreconditionCheck and SkillExecution and support the usefulness of using ParameterSetIDs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Ruskowski";Machining of Individualized Milled Parts in a Skill-Based Production Environment;2023;Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering;Changing markets, individualized products, and volatile supply chains require a high degree of flexibility, especially in production and manufacturing. A promising approach to reconfigurable and flexible manufacturing is the use of machine-level skills. This paper presents a simple architecture for skill-based machining of individualized milled parts. A transport system and a machine tool are controlled purely by skills using a defined OPC UA interface. Production orders can be generated from a CAD system or received via the GAIA-X network. The order data as well as information about the manufacturing process are stored in a Product Asset Administration Shell, which is interpreted by a production flow control. Sequentially, different skills for the manufacturing process are executed on the resources. This enables the direct production of individualized parts that are available in CAD. With the architecture presented, there is no need to generate machine code using CAM tools, NC programming or shop floor programming. This is because the intelligence required for the manufacturing process is encapsulated behind the defined OPC UA skill interface, which requires only the geometric data of the features of the CAD part.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This allows for a dynamic allocation of tasks to resources. This paper reports the ongoing work on applying the concept of capabilities and skills to an industrial application example in order to investigate its potential benefits. To apply the abstract concept of capabilities and skills to the production scenario it is implemented using specific technologies.

Symp. on Robotics (ISR2012);This article presents a unifying terminology for task-level programming of highly flexible mobile manipulators in industrial environments. With a terminology of tasks and object-centered skills, industrial applications are analyzed in the logistic and assistive domains. The analysis shows that many tasks can actually be solved with a small library of predefined building blocks, called skills. In logistics domains, it can be exploited that the sequences of skills needed to solve specific tasks follow certain patterns, whereas in assistive tasks, the sequence vary a lot, and tasks must be taught to the robot by a user, based on Standard Operating Procedures or process knowledge. An overview is presented on how to implement a skill-based architecture, enabling reuse of skills for different industrial applications, programmed by shopfloor workers. The terminology of tasks, skills, and motion primitives is introduced and designed to separate responsibilities of robot system developers, robot system integrators and shop floor users concerning programming of the robot system. The concept of testable pre- and postconditions assigned to the skills are proposed to help both in developing skills and asserting when a skill is applicable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Separatingcoordination from functional computations is a key principle for building complex, robust and reusable robotic systems. This work introduces a minimal variant of Harel statecharts called rFSM designed to model coordination of robotic tasks and systems with a minimal number of semantic primitives. Firstly, the semantics of the rFSM language are derived by analyzing state-of-the-art discrete event models and implementations and extracting a motivated and semantically well-defined subset that is considered best practice for the domain of robotic coordination. Secondly, a real-time capable reference implementation of rFSM is presented, which has been loosely integrated into the OROCOS/RTT framework. The application of rFSM is illustrated using a detailed description of a dual robot coordination problem. Lastly, several best practices and patterns are presented with the goal of i) supporting development of robust Coordination models, ii) illustrating how limitations of the statechart model can be overcome by extending the execution semantics, and iii) offering guidance in designing pure coordination components that optimize reusability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To make this possible the programming of robots and especially robot cells and the integration of new devices into these robot cells has to be much easier than today. The approach of this paper is to offer the user of a robot cell in SME-environments an easy means of programming a cell without the need to do the configuration. Therefore, commands that represent the functionality of devices have to be offered. A concept and a first implementation are presented to describe the functionality of devices on the one hand and the required functionality of processes on the other hand. Based on this information a configuration module is able to determine what processes can be executed by the available set of devices and therefore what commands the user can choose from on a HMI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
577;Configuration model for evolvable assembly systems;Link;Springer;"P. Ferreira; N. Lohse";Configuration model for evolvable assembly systems;2012;4th CIRP Conference On Assembly Technologies And Systems;The assembly systems domain in recent years has been pressed to provide highly adaptable and quickly deployable solutions and deal with unpredictable changes according to market trends. Furthermore, the current decreasing product lifecycles provided the need for more reusable assembly systems to distribute the system costs across different products. In this context a new concept of Evolvable Assembly Systems has been introduced in this research domain to address these issues. The introduction of this approach presents new challenges but also opportunities for current modular assembly system configuration methods. While the focus on standardised process models makes more automatic configuration approaches more feasible, challenges of how to effectively manage such standards arise at the same time. Furthermore, higher and lower levels of granularity in assembly system modularisation require hierarchical decomposition and consequently synthesis which are notoriously challenging topics for automatic configuration methods. This paper reports on a new configuration method which use a process focused semantic model, as basis for assembly system configuration. The paper identifies all the necessary concepts that enable evolvable assembly systems, namely the assembly system requirements, equipment definition, capability models and overall evolvable assembly system operation process. The potential of this approach is shown to significantly reduce the system configuration and control deployment effort for agent-based modular assembly systems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While models consisting of formalized knowledge are used during the engineering step, running systems usually do not contain a high-level, symbolic representation of the control and most of its properties, typically named numerical parameters. On a system level and beyond the plant data, there is also a need to represent the meaning of the data such that deployment and fault analysis could be augmented with partly automated inference based on the semantics of the data. To that end, we extended the formalized knowledge traditionally used in control to include the control purpose, engineering assumption, quality, involved state machines, and so on. We then represented the control semantics in a format that allows an easier extraction of information using querying and reasoning. It aims at making knowledge in control engineering reusable so that it can be shipped together with the control systems. We implemented prototypes that include automatic conversion of plant data from AutomationML into RDF triples, as well as the automated extraction of control properties, the conversion of parameters, and their storage in the same triple store. Although these techniques are standard within the semantic web community, we believe that our robotic prototypes for semantic control represent a novel approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The question of the appropriate abstraction level of robot actions is still being researched and not discussed conclusively.

Hanisch";The IDEAS project: plug and produce at shop‐floor level;2012;Assembly Automation;Purpose – Current major roadmapping efforts have all clearly underlined that true industrial sustainability will require far higher levels of systems’ autonomy and adaptability. In accordance with these recommendations, the Evolvable Assembly Systems (EAS) has aimed at developing such technological solutions and support mechanisms. Since its inception in 2002 as a next generation of production systems, the concept is being further developed and tested to emerge as a production system paradigm. The essence of evolvability resides not only in the ability of system components to adapt to the changing conditions of operation, but also to assist in the evolution of these components in time. Characteristically, Evolvable Systems have distributed control, and are composed of intelligent modules with embedded control. To assist the development and life cycle, a methodological framework is being developed. After validating the process-oriented approach (EC FP6 EUPASS project), EAS now tackles its current major challenge (FP7 IDEAS project) in proving that factory responsiveness can be improved using lighter multi-agent technology running on EAS modules (modules with embedded control). The purpose of this paper is to detail the particular developments within the IDEAS project, which include the first self re-configuring system demonstration and a new mechatronic architecture.Design/methodology/approach – The paper covers the development of a plug & produce system for FESTO AG. The work covers the Background methodology and details its constituents: control system, architecture, design methodology, and modularity. Specific detail is reserved for the configuration approach which integrates several tools, and the commercially available control boards. The latter have been specifically developed for distributed control applications.Findings – The paper details probably the first self-configuring assembly system at shop-floor level. This is one of the very first industrial plug & produce systems, in which equipment may be added/removed with no programming effort at all.Research limitations/implications – The paper reports the findings and development carried out within the framework of a single project. It also clarifies that the solution is not a general panacea for all the issues within assembly.Practical implications – The implications are quite large as the work proves the validity of an approach that could change our way of designing and building assembly systems. In the words of an industrial partner, this is “a new way of engineering assembly systems”.Social implications – Should this approach be used in industry then the implications could be huge. It would, for example, mean that new services are created, whereby assembly system modules are leased to users through a network of depots, rather than bought at a high cost. The system modules also have a far longer lifespan, implying very good ecological solutions.Originality/value – The highly original paper describes what is probably one of the very first projects to show that distributed control at shop-floor level is viable and technologically feasible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The ros_control framework provides the capability to implement and manage robot controllers with a focus on both real-time performance and sharing of controllers in a robot-agnostic way. The primary motivation for a separate robot-control framework is the lack of real-time safe communication layer in ROS. Furthermore, the framework implements solutions for controller lifecycle and hardware resource management as well as abstractions on hardware interfaces with minimal assumptions on hardware or operating system. The clear, modular design of ros_control makes it ideal for both research and industrial use and has indeed seen many such applications to date. The idea of ros_control originates from the pr2_controller_manager framework specific to the PR2 robot but ros_control is fully robot-agnostic. Controllers expose standard ROS interfaces for out-of-the-box third-party solutions to robotics problems like manipulation path planning (MoveIt! (Chitta, Sucan, and Cousins 2012)) and autonomous navigation (the ROS navigation stack). Hence, a robot made up of a mobile base and an arm that support ros_control doesn’t need any additional code to be written, only a few controller configuration files, and it is ready to navigate autonomously and do path planning for the arm. ros_control also provides several libraries to support writing custom controllers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Malec";Knowledge-based instruction of manipulation tasks for industrial robotics;2015;Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing;When robots are working in dynamic environments, close to humans lacking extensive knowledge of robotics, there is a strong need to simplify the user interaction and make the system execute as autonomously as possible, as long as it is feasible. For industrial robots working side-by-side with humans in manufacturing industry, AI systems are necessary to lower the demand on programming time and system integration expertise. Only by building a system with appropriate knowledge and reasoning services can one simplify the robot programming sufficiently to meet those demands while still getting a robust and efficient task execution. In this paper, we present a system we have realized that aims at fulfilling the above demands. The paper focuses on the knowledge put into ontologies created for robotic devices and manufacturing tasks, and presents examples of AI-related services that use the semantic descriptions of skills to help users instruct the robot adequately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Hodek";Leveraging the Agility of Manufacturing Chains by Combining Process-Oriented Production Planning and Service-Oriented Manufacturing Automation;2011;IFAC Proceedings Volumes;Globalization, rising product variety, the need for continuously improving productivity and quality demand higher agility of manufacturing systems. Well-known principles like encapsulating functionality into mechatronic systems to enable reuse and standardization are basic approaches to gain agility in manufacturing environments. However, there is a lack of a holistic communication architecture for manufacturing systems and an overall concept to organize the continuously changing production planning and control processes. The paradigm of service-oriented architectures emerged as a concept to increase the flexibility and reuse within IT environments by using software modules with standardized communication interfaces. Transferring this paradigm to the field of manufacturing offers a unique opportunity to complement the advances of standardized communication interfaces and mechatronic encapsulation with powerful production planning and control methods. In this paper the central aspects and the potentials of transferring service-oriented paradigms from IT to automation are discussed. The methodology of process-oriented manufacturing planning is presented as the organizational fundament for an efficient establishment of service-oriented manufacturing systems. An approach for a process-oriented factory model is presented as the basis for a process-oriented planning process. Furthermore, a technical demonstrator that provides the opportunity for evaluating SOA technologies and our new planning approach is shown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Delamer; J.L.M. Lastra";Service-Oriented Architecture for Distributed Publish/Subscribe Middleware in Electronics Production;2006;IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics;The Computer Aided Manufacturing using XML (CAMX) framework enables integrating electronics production systems using message-oriented middleware, offering standards-based communication among machines and control software applications. CAMX frameworks implement publish/subscribe of XML messages through an entity called the message broker (MSB), which provides the messaging service using a web-based interface. A challenge for MSB-based systems is that they must scale to handle large volumes of messaging traffic, which is a characteristic of modern information-intensive manufacturing systems. This paper first tackles this challenge by presenting an array of architecture patterns for creating distributed MSB frameworks, focusing mainly on globally distributed federations and locally distributed clusters. A unified architecture is subsequently presented that leverages the different patterns by combining federated frameworks with locally distributed clusters into a unified set of architecture elements and interactions. A service-oriented approach is followed to provide a uniform interface for distributed MSB elements, whether federated or locally distributed. The service-oriented approach is also used to dynamically discover resources and automatically invoke the (re)configuration and messaging services. The services are enriched with semantics in order to facilitate automatic discovery and selection of services using the semantic web services formal ontology. Semantic service advertisements are propagated using a peer-to-peer discovery protocol. The approach presented in this paper is not limited to the CAMX case and is generally applicable to distributed event-based manufacturing systems;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The approach integrates both instantaneous task specification and estimation of geometric uncertainty in a unified framework. Major components are the use of feature coordinates, defined with respect to object and feature frames, which facilitate the task specification, and the introduction of uncertainty coordinates to model geometric uncertainty. While the focus of the paper is on task specification, an existing velocity- based control scheme is reformulated in terms of these feature and uncertainty coordinates. This control scheme compensates for the effect of time varying uncertainty coordinates. Constraint weighting results in an invariant robot behavior in case of conflicting constraints with heterogeneous units. The approach applies to a large variety of robot systems (mobile robots, multiple robot systems, dynamic human-robot interaction, etc.), various sensor systems, and different robot tasks. Ample simulation and experimental results are presented.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Wortmann";Multi-Level Modeling Framework for Machine as a Service Applications Based on Product Process Resource Models;2018;Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium on Computer Science and Intelligent Control;At present, manufacturing processes are highly tailored to a specific product. Changes in product requirements therefore lead to big manual efforts for adapting the manufacturing process and reconfiguring production resources accordingly. Existing approaches do not cope well with this complexity. This hinders agile, customer-oriented manufacturing. A promising approach for automated assembling processes is the Machine as a Service paradigm, which aims for providing production resources on demand. This requires a consistent and pervasive formalization of product specifications, the corresponding manufacturing resources and their interdependencies. Thus, our first contribution is a generic and extensible multi-level and modular modeling framework to formalize products and available resources. Our framework is scalable for large companies and enables reuse for cross-company collaboration and supplier integration. Thereby, the static relationship between product, process and resource is avoided by describing product features and resource skills in separate models. Our framework uses the standardized SysML/UML. Our second contribution is the ability of our framework to integrate different standards. For demonstration, we apply our multi-level approach to a flexible assembly of terminal boxes for transmission gears and show the integration of standards by embedding the eCl@ss classification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This system was developed to replace and improve upon the conventional robot control scheme of teaching-by-showing and replay. The key concept of this system consists of the combination of manipulation skills with an environment model. The model provides the geometric structure and the physical properties of the objects in the environment. Manipulation skills enable reliable task execution in the presence of unavoidable errors and uncertainties. Skills are implemented within the hybrid position/velocity/force control scheme and incorporate sensing procedures to detect the state to be achieved.

They combine easy task specification and execution which are key components for the success of this paradigm. However, there are some flaws when describing a complex task by decomposing it into Manipulation Primitives. For instance, the relations between the individual Manipulation Primitives cannot be captured by the original definition but have to be defined in additional glue code. This contribution introduces an extended definition of Manipulation Primitives to describe manipulation tasks as hierarchical structures using Manipulation Primitives at each level of the hierarchy. Additionally, a concept for a generic control architecture is presented which is capable of meeting the requirements of the extended Manipulation Primitive concept and which can be easily plugged“ together using modular code blocks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Its main focus is on the automatic generation and parameterization of the assembly sequence, which should provide maximal robustness with respect to positioning errors of the robot and residual position uncertainties of vision based object localization. The assembly utilizes active or passive compliance of the robot in order to align the parts automatically. Success of the automatic alignment, i.e. the convergence of the assembly process can be guaranteed using the means of regions of attraction (ROA). The planning optimizes the assembly trajectories and parameters in such a way that the ROA is maximized for a given part geometry. For the convergence analysis, passivity properties of the robot and the environment are used. The method is validated through extensive experiments and can be successfully applied also for the automated assembly planning with passive compliance devices, as widely used today in industrial automation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Fay";A Formal Capability and Skill Model for Use in Plug and Produce Scenarios;2020;2020 25th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA);Manufacturing companies face an environment that is dominated by influences which affect the usage of their manufacturing equipment. Trends like shortening life cycles of products, increasing numbers of product variants and the resulting decrease in lot sizes put pressure on companies’ operations. Existing machines have to be adaptable to provide a high degree of flexibility and new machines have to be easily integrated into an existing plant in a plug and produce fashion. Research contributions that focus on a higher level description of machine functionalities are seen as a promising approach to cope with the aforementioned challenges. While there exists quite a large amount of contributions on this topic, these contributions focus either on formal models or on executable functions. The developed models mostly represent project specific contents and are rarely based on industry standards.In this contribution, we present an approach to a formal model of machine capabilities that directly includes a description of executable skills. The presented capability and skill model is based on a variety of separate so-called ontology design patterns that contain the vocabulary of industry standards and therefore provide a profound knowledge which is agreed upon by a large community. In addition to the description of our model, this contribution shows how these models can be used in order to achieve simple and rapid integration of new manufacturing modules and their capabilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Fay";Automating the Development of Machine Skills and their Semantic Description;2020;2020 25th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA);In order to approach the vision of quickly integrating new machines and their functionalities into a production plant, machines have to provide a machine-readable description of themselves and their functionalities. With such a description, it becomes possible to find required functions, check compatibility and, finally, execute production processes. In recent years, semantic web technologies have proven to be a promising enabler to realize such descriptions in the form of ontologies. But the creation of such an ontological description is an additional, tedious and error-prone task for a machine developer who might most likely not be an expert in semantic web technologies. In order to support developers in implementing machine function-alities as semantically described skills, we developed a method that highly automates all additional ontology-related tasks. The presented method makes use of information already contained in engineering artifacts, helps in adding additional information, and provides a framework to implement skill behavior. By using the proposed method, machine developers are put in a position to develop formal capability models themselves and with little additional effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Fay";A SysML-based Function-Centered Approach for the Modeling of System Groups for Collaborative Cyber-Physical Systems;2022;2022 IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon);Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are able to collaborate with other CPSs in their environment. Such collaboration, which contains a suitable combination and aggregation of the individual functions of different CPSs, makes it possible that goals can be jointly achieved that the individual CPS would not have been able to achieve on its own. As part of the collaboration, the collaborative CPSs, which may come from different manufacturers, form temporary system groups in which they assume different roles and associated responsibilities. This paper presents a domain-independent function-centered approach that enables the modeling of such system groups at the design time of the single collaborative CPS and thus serves as a basis for cross-manufacturer collaboration planning. The approach describes in 6 steps how the constitution and the behavior of the system group with its participants can be modeled with the help of functions and independent of specific components. The modeling is based on the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), which has been extended to be able to express aspects of the system group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper focuses on the integration of these two approaches to enable Cyber-Physical Production Modules to use skills in a more cooperative manner. First, we describe the existing OPC UA skill models and their abilities to abstract complex production processes. Then, we concentrate on modelling of the I4.0 language messages and the interaction state machines for the ”skill execution” semantic interaction protocol as well as its representation in an Asset Administration Shell.

The latter task is also supported by simulation tools where even certain process parameters can be varied. But there is hardly any support on the software side easing this work in general. This paper shows an approach of considering the production process from a workpiece-centered view.

We discuss a proposed solution to this representational discontinuity in the form of object-action complexes (OACs). The pairing of actions and objects in a single interface representation captures the needs of both reasoning levels, and will enable machine learning of high-level action representations from low-level control representations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Szynkiewicz;Skill-Based Bimanual Manipulation Planning;2012;Journal of Telecommunications and Information Technology;The paper focuses on specification and utilization of manipulation skills to facilitate programming of bimanual manipulation tasks. Manipulation skills are actions to reach predefined goals. They constitute an interface between low-level constraint-based task specification and high level symbolic task planning. The task of the robot can be decomposed into subtasks that can be resolved using manipulation skills. Rubik’s cube solving problem is presented as an example of a 3D manipulation task using two-arm robot system with diverse sensors such as vision, force/torque, tactile sensors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
616;A Generic Plug & Produce System Composed of Semantic OPC UA Skills;10.1109/OJIES.2021.3055461;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE);"S. Profanter; A. Perzylo; M. Rickert; A. Knoll";"A Generic Plug &amp; Produce System Composed of Semantic OPC UA Skills";2021;IEEE Open Journal of the Industrial Electronics Society;Typical industrial workcells are composed of a plenitude of devices from various manufacturers, which rely on their own specific control interfaces. To reduce setup and reconfiguration times, a hardware-agnostic Plug & Produce system is required. In this paper, we present a system architecture that uses generic and semantically augmented OPC UA skills for robots, tools, and other system components. Standardized skill interfaces and parameters facilitate flexible component interchange and automatic parametrization with a focus on reusability of skills across different platforms and domains. The hierarchical composition of such skills allows for additional abstraction through the grouping of functionalities. Through the extension of OPC UA discovery services, available skills are dynamically detected whenever a manufacturing system's component is updated. The introduced Plug & Produce system is evaluated in multiple industrial workcells composed of robots, tool changer, electric parallel gripper, and vacuum gripper—all controlled via the proposed OPC UA skill interface. The evaluation of our system architecture demonstrates the applicability of the Plug & Produce concept in the domain of robot-based industrial assembly. Although it is necessary to adapt existing hardware to comply with the semantic skill concept, the initial one-time effort yields reoccurring efficiency gains during system reconfiguration. In particular, small lot production benefits from reduced changeover times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Syntactic descriptions of input and output parameters, e.g., using interface description languages (IDL), are not sufficient when it comes to evaluating whether a manufacturing resource provides the capabilities that are required for performing a particular process step on a product. The semantics of capabilities needs to be explicitly modelled and must be provided together with manufacturing resources. In this paper, we introduce concepts developed by the German BaSys 4.0 initiative dealing with semantically describing manufacturing skills, orchestrating higher-level skills from basic skills, and using them in a cognitive manufacturing framework.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Zoitl";Capability-based planning and scheduling for adaptable manufacturing systems;2014;Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE Emerging Technology and Factory Automation (ETFA);Manufacturing enterprises can only stay profitable if they manage to flexibly respond to changes in markets by adapting their products, product variants, and product volumes. To support such variety in products, we suggest a capability-based approach for production planning and scheduling. Production plans and machines are described in terms of required capabilities and provided capabilities respectively. Additionally, the topology of the factory is described. We propose to combine these descriptions to automatically generate production schedules that consider the material flow in the factory. For each production plan, our approach generates a valid schedule for the currently available machines in the factory without manually reconfiguring the software. The evaluation of the approach on an industrial production system used for educational purposes shows the suitability of this approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Vogel-Heuser";Automatic Generation of Field Control Strategies for Supporting (Re-)Engineering of Manufacturing Systems;2012;IFAC Proceedings Volumes;This paper presents an approach to enable automatic identification and generation of operation strategies for field-level automation software of manufacturing systems. Contrary to the traditional way of implementing field control software, we suggest the modelling and implementation of machine capabilities as basic operations. Driven by the idea to describe what a system is able to do in contrast to traditional formulation of processes in automation software engineering, it is possible to derive necessary sequences of control operations automatically. This results in a framework for automatic generation of such operation strategies to limit the re-engineering effort of field-level automation control software in case of changed requirements caused by modifications of the technical system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Reinhart";Classification, Modelling and Mapping of Skills in Automated Production Systems;2014;Enabling Manufacturing Competitiveness and Economic Sustainability;The ability to enable a quick modification and system-change is one of the essential requirements of future production systems. The two basic steps to adapt an automated production system to a new task are the reconfiguration and the reprogramming. Against this background, the central objective of this paper is the discussion of a concept to simplify the programming. Assuming the use of standard industry devices, there is a lack in the ability to gather the necessary information about the available equipment automatically. Each device allocates its inherent skills through different functions, commands and interfaces. A classification and a method to map the devices’ skills to the program of automation systems have been developed to handle and interpret these skills. The concept and its application are described in this paper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Barto";Robot learning from demonstration by constructing skill trees;2011;The International Journal of Robotics Research;We describe CST, an online algorithm for constructing skill trees from demonstration trajectories. CST segments a demonstration trajectory into a chain of component skills, where each skill has a goal and is assigned a suitable abstraction from an abstraction library. These properties permit skills to be improved efficiently using a policy learning algorithm. Chains from multiple demonstration trajectories are merged into a skill tree. We show that CST can be used to acquire skills from human demonstration in a dynamic continuous domain, and from both expert demonstration and learned control sequences on the uBot-5 mobile manipulator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Barata";A Multiagent Control System for Shop Floor Assembly;2007;Lecture Notes in Computer Science;Current globalization associated to new customers’ needs are decreasing products’ life-cycle and pushing researchers to find new ways to provide shop floor assembly systems with agility to adapt to this new volatile reality. This document describes a multiagent implementation to control a shop floor system, with increased plug and play capabilities and providing fast system (re)configuration. In this approach, each shop floor component was agentified enhancing its adaptability and interaction competences to respond to environmental requests. Each agent representing a shop floor component can be aggregated to form a coalition that coordinates higher level processes (complex skills) based on the ones available in its members. An ontology is used to ensure an accurate information exchange, as well as to define the domain and relations between entities. This approach also shows how to adapt legacy systems to support innovative approaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
