## About Me

I am a professor for model-driven development in production automation at the [Institute for Machine Tools and Manufacturing Units](https://www.isw.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) (ISW) of the University of Stuttgart. Before, I was senior researcher at the Chair for Software Engineering at RWTH Aachen University and head of the Model-Driven Systems Engineering research group. 
My research interests are modeling languages, methods, and tools to facilitate the systematic engineering of the cyber-physical systems of the future and transfer this into practice in a variety of research projects. 
Among these are the [Internet of Production](https://www.iop.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~gpfz/Produktionstechnik/?lidx=1), the [Center for Systems Engineering](https://cse.rwth-campus.com/), and the [Systematic Engineering of Consistent Digital Twins](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/vuc/lidx/1).

Moreover, I serve on the board of the [European Association for Programming Languages and Systems (EAPLS)](https://eapls.org/), on the editorial boards of the [International Journal on Software and Systems Modeling (SoSyM)](https://sosym.org/) and the [Journal of Object Technology](http://www.jot.fm/), and engage in a variety of academic and community service.
