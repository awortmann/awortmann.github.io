## About Me

I am a software engineering research associate at RWTH Aachen University with interests in Model-Driven Systems Engineering, Software Language Engineering, and Software Architectures and their application to Automotive, Digital Transformation, Smart Manufacturing, and Robotics. 

At the Chair of Software Engineering of RWTH Aachen University, I lead the working group on [Model-Driven Systems Engineering](https://www.se-rwth.de/teams/mdse/) in which research on modeling languages, methods, and tools to facilitate the systematic engineering of the cyber-physical systems of the future and transfer this into practice in a variety of research projects. Among these are the [Internet of Production](https://www.iop.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~gpfz/Produktionstechnik/?lidx=1), the [Center for Systems Engineering](https://cse.rwth-campus.com/), and the [Systematic Engineering of Consistent Digital Twins](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/vuc/lidx/1).

Moreover, I serve on the board of the [European Association for Programming Languages and Systems (EAPLS)](https://eapls.org/), on the editorial board of the [Journal of Automotive Software Engineering](https://www.atlantis-press.com/journals/jase), and engage in a variety of academic and community service.
