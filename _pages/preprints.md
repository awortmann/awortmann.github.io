#### Journal on Empirical Software Engineering

- Rodi Jolak, Maxime Savary-Leblanc, Manuela Dalibor, Andreas Wortmann, Regina Hebig, Juraj Vincur, Ivan Polasek, Xavier Le Pallec, Sébastien Gérard, and Michel R. V. Chaudron: [Software engineering whispers: The effect of textual vs. graphical software design descriptions on software design communication](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-020-09835-6?wt_mc=Internal.Event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst). The paper investigate the effect of using a graphical versus textual design description on co-located software design communication through a family of experiments involving a mix of 240 software engineering students from four European universities. In these, we examined how different design representations affect the ability to explain, understand, recall, and actively communicate knowledge.

#### 23rd International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS)

The following papers have been accepted to [MODELS'20](http://www.modelsconference.org/) and will be presented between October 18 and 23 during the virtual conference.

- Arvid Butting, Jerome Pfeiffer, Bernhard Rumpe, Andreas Wortmann: [A Compositional Framework for Systematic Language Reuse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awortmann/awortmann.github.io/master/downloads/preprints/2020/models/A_Compositional_Frameworkfor_Systematic_Modeling_Language_Reuse.pdf). The paper presents results on the systematic reuse of textual, external, and translational modeling languages via composing language components encapsulating grammars, well-formedness rules, and generators with explicit interfaces.

- Jörg Christian Kirchhof, Judith Michael, Bernhard Rumpe, Simon Varga, Andreas Wortmann: [Model-driven Digital Twin Construction : Synthesizing the Integration of Cyber-Physical Systems with Their Information Systems](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awortmann/awortmann.github.io/master/downloads/preprints/2020/models/Model-driven_Digital_Twin_Construction_-_Synthesizing_the_Integration_of_Cyber-Physical_Systems_with_Their_Information_Systems.pdf). The paper presents a constructive model-driven approach to the integration of digital twins with information systems.

- Imke Drave, Bernhard Rumpe, Andreas Wortmann, Joerg Berroth, Gregor Hoepfner, Georg Jacobs, Kathrin Spuetz, Thilo Zerwas, Christian Guist, Jens Kohl: [Modeling Mechanical Functional Architectures in SysML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awortmann/awortmann.github.io/master/downloads/preprints/2020/models/Modeling_Mechanical_Functional_Architectures_in_SysML.PDF). The paper describes a method for systematically modeling mechanical functional architectures and mapping these to their geometric-physical realizations with SysML.
