#### 23rd International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS)

The following papers have been accepted to [MODELS'20](http://www.modelsconference.org/) and will be presented between October 18 and 23 during the virtual conference.

- The paper [A Compositional Framework for Systematic Language Reuse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awortmann/awortmann.github.io/master/downloads/preprints/2020/models/A_Compositional_Frameworkfor_Systematic_Modeling_Language_Reuse.pdf) presents results on the systematic reuse of textual, external, and translational modeling languages via composing language components encapsulating grammars, well-formedness rules, and generators with explicit interfaces.

- The paper [Model-driven Digital Twin Construction : Synthesizing the Integration of Cyber-Physical Systems with Their Information Systems](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awortmann/awortmann.github.io/master/downloads/preprints/2020/models/Model-driven_Digital_Twin_Construction_-_Synthesizing_the_Integration_of_Cyber-Physical_Systems_with_Their_Information_Systems.pdf) presents a constructive model-driven approach to the integration of digital twins with information systems.

- The paper [Modeling Mechanical Functional Architectures in SysML](https://github.com/awortmann/awortmann.github.io/raw/master/downloads/preprints/2020/models/Modeling_Mechanical_Functional_Architectures_in_SysML.PDF) describes a method for systematically modeling mechanical functional architectures and mapping these to their geometric-physical realizations with SysML.
