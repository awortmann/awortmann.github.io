## On the Challenges of Integrating Digital Twins

Digital Twins (DTs) are a key technology for smart ecosystems to provide accurate digital representation of their constituents, e.g., smart buildings, farms, transportation, and citizens, as well as synchronization between the digital and the real subject, and the exploration of what-if scenarios and trade-off reasoning. To cope with emerging complex socio-technical ecosystems, we need to bring DTs together, which is a challenging
endeavor. After giving a historical overview of system adaptation, we review the many enabling technologies that can help with DT integration. Using a smart city as an illuminating example to highlight scenarios that require integration of DTs, we discuss a model-based conceptual framework that identifies DT integration strategies and elaborate on nine key integration challenges that still need to be addressed. We call on the DT community to investigate these challenges.

## Digital Twins for Machine Tools: A Systematic Mapping Study

Machine tools are essential for modern manufacturing and drive the production of precise and high-quality components across various industries. For smart manufacturing, DTs–virtual representations of cyber-physical entities–have emerged to enhance machine tools with intelligent capabilities, such as real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, or performance optimization. Despite their potential, the availability and application of Digital Twins in machine tools remain largely unexplored. This first systematic mapping study specifically on Digital Twins for machine tools investigates the purpose for their deployment to machine tools, the development methods to create such Digital Twins, and support for their connectivity to the machine tool and to other related systems. Our findings highlight the critical role of DTs in improving the efficiency and reliability of machine tools.

## Towards a Unifying Reference Model for Digital Twins of Cyber-Physical Systems (ETFA 2025)

Digital twins are sophisticated software systems for the representation, monitoring, and control of cyber-physical systems, including automotive, avionics, smart manufacturing, and many more. Existing definitions and reference models of digital twins are overly abstract, impeding their comprehensive understanding and implementation guidance. Consequently, a significant gap emerges between abstract concepts and their industrial implementations. We analyze popular reference models for digital twins and combine these into a significantly detailed unifying reference model for digital twins that reduces the concept-implementation gap to facilitate their engineering in industrial practice. This enhances the understanding of the concepts of digital twins and their relationships and guides developers to implement digital twins effectively.

## Navigating the Future - Essential Considerations for the Engineering of Software-Defined Vehicles (IEEE Computer)

Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) represent a transformative shift in the automotive industry, moving from traditional vehicle development to software-driven mobility solutions. The engineering of SDVs is inherently complex and involves numerous technological and organizational challenges. Future challenges include increased software complexity, managing software updates, cultural gaps, and complying with international standards and regulations. Additionally, the rapid pace of  technological change demands an efficient and effective engineering process. To remain competitive and achieve their business goals, automotive organizations must adopt new strategies and undergo significant changes in the following software development concerns: architecture, process, and organization. These changes are necessary to boost productivity and improve the efficiency of the engineering process of SDVs.

## Two Decades of Automated AI Planning Methods in Construction and Fabrication: A Systematic Review (ACM Computing Surveys)

Task planning and scheduling are crucial for construction or fabrication (CF) processes. Automating them is necessary for more efficient plans in terms of time and resources. However, most construction planning processes are still performed manually despite the existence of various AI methods. Symbolic AI automated task planning (ATP) techniques offer a variety of features to tackle task planning problems, but their application to CF has not been researched yet. This study identifies the current state of research and gaps in the literature regarding these AI techniques while providing directions for future research. We conduct a systematic review that evaluates existing literature on ATP in terms of environmental characteristics, modeling languages, ATP techniques, and results. We searched the ACM, IEEE, Scopus, WOS, and SpringerLink databases for papers published in the last 20 years (2002-2022) that discuss symbolic AI methods used in task planning within the CF fields. Our findings indicate that research on automated planning is currently limited regarding the characteristics of CF environments. Only a few papers have utilized symbolic languages, AI planners, and ATP techniques. No paper has evaluated their planning system in an on-site CF process. As a result, many symbolic languages, planners, and ATP techniques remain unexplored.

## Analysis and Review of Use Case Representations in OPC UA Companion Specifications

For industrial data management, OPC UA data models are increasing in popularity. Domain models (e.g., Robotics, Mining) are developed by
groups of industry representatives and published as so-called Companion Specifications. These Companion Specifications mention use cases that
are to be addressed, however with different approaches. In this work, these use case descriptions are analyzed regarding their benefit to users of
the specification. The textual representations and the graphics used are compared and the use cases are categorized by expressiveness. A
categorization of use case contents is performed. The findings are discussed and suggestions for use case representations are derived from the
results. These suggestions serve as a tool to editors of the companion specifications and aim to improve understandability.

## Energy Efficiency in ROS Communication: A Comparison Across Programming Languages and Workloads (Frontiers in Robotics and AI)

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a widely used framework for robotic software development, providing robust client libraries for both C++ and Python. These languages, with their differing levels of abstraction, exhibit distinct resource usage patterns, including power and energy consumption -an increasingly critical quality metric in robotics.Methods: In this study, we evaluate the energy efficiency of ROS 2 nodes implemented in C++ and Python, focusing on the primary ROS communication paradigms: topics, services, and actions.Through a series of empirical experiments, with programming language, message interval, and number of clients as independent variables, we analyze the impact on energy efficiency across implementations of the three paradigms.Results: Our data analysis demonstrates that Python consistently demands more computational resources, leading to higher power consumption compared to C++. Furthermore, we find that message frequency is a highly influential factor, while the number of clients has a more variable and less significant effect on resource usage, despite revealing unexpected architectural behaviors of underlying programming and communication layers.

## Digital Twins for Software Engineering Processes (ICSE 2025 NIER)

Digital twins promise a better understanding and use of complex systems. To this end, they represent these systems at their runtime and may interact with them to control their processes. Software engineering is a wicked challenge in which stakeholders from many domains collaborate to produce software artifacts together. In the presence of skilled software engineer shortage, our vision is to leverage DTs as means for better representing, understanding, and optimizing software engineering processes to (i) enable software experts making the best use of their time and (ii) support domain experts in producing high-quality software. This paper outlines why this would be beneficial, what such a digital twin could look like, and what is missing for realizing and deploying software engineering digital twins.

## Identifying machine times with OPC UA for Equipment as a Service (CIRP CMS 2024)

With Equipment as a Service (EaaS), subscription-based business models are becoming increasingly popular in mechanical and plant engineering. The main argument in favor for EaaS is a better overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) when a factory supplier operates the equipment. Therefore, the constant determination of the OEE in EaaS operations becomes crucial. This value is usually determined combining data retrieved from the equipment itself in combination with data from higher level systems like the manufacturing execution system (MES) of the customers. The latter are not accessible by the factory supplier. To bridge this information gap, the OEE of a piece of equipment is determined based solely on the available equipment data retrieved through data exchange standards such as the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA). To achieve this, the time information needed to determine the OEE as defined in the ISO 22400-2 standard is either directly determined from OPC UA data from the machines or approximated through assumptions and exclusions. As an example for the mapping of equipment data to different time information, machine tools are focused and, hence, OPC UA 40501 and OPC UA 40001. In addition, the findings are analyzed regarding limitations in using the available time data via OPC UA. The mapping’s applicability is demonstrated with an exemplary use case and the OEE is compared when calculated only with equipment data retrieved via OPC UA with the OEE calculation having the additional information from a higher level system. This comparison allows to evaluate the uncertainty introduced by making assumptions and exclusions. The results are a valuable input to supplement the OPC UA Companion Specifications in order to cover the OEE determination in EaaS use cases.
