## Software Language Engineering

The efficient engineering of suitable (domain-specific) modeling languages is a crucial prerequisite for the vision of model-driven systems engineering. 
This demands for concepts, methods, and tools facilitating the creation, maintenance, and reuse of holistic languages (comprising realizations of syntax and semantics), which demands for a novel understanding of languages as holistic units that can be subjected to integrated engineering, reuse, and tailoring.

Our research in software language engineering addresses these challenges through novel concepts and models the systematic reuse of syntaxes [BEK+19],
the black-box composition of code generators [BEK+18b], and their holistic reuse through combination [Wor19].

# Research Projects

## Center for Systems Engineering

The [Center for Systems Engineering](https://cse.rwth-campus.com/) aims to shape and holistically assess the required key technologies for tomorrow’s product development process. The integration of the individual development steps and tools enables a highly iterative, agile, and in part automated product development. This will facilitate model-based systems engineering in research and practice.

## Collaborative Embedded Systems (CrESt)

With the transition from classical embedded systems to networked, collaborative embedded systems, a wide range of new applications for the German industry is emerging. The ability of a company to efficiently develop collaborative embedded systems with highest quality will therefore become a decisive competitive factor. The project [Collaborative Embedded Systems (CrESt)](https://crest.in.tum.de/) aims to create a comprehensive framework for the model-driven development of collaborative embedded systems that addresses novel challenges in their engineering based on the SPES development methodology.

## Intelligent Modular Service Robotics in Human Environments (iserveU)

While various challenging issues for service robotics have been solved to a degree where their deployment is possible, integration of the corresponding hardware components and software components requires the intensive collaboration of domain experts, robotics experts, and software experts. The [iserveU project](https://www.se-rwth.de/materials/iserveu/) investigates the feasibility of pervasive model-driven software engineering for complex service robotics applications.

## Systematic Engineering of Consistent Digital Twins

Digital twins of manufacturing systems should help to control production to reduce downtimes and make better use of resources. This requires the detection of deviations from the expected system behavior. With this knowledge, deviations in system parts due to wear and tear can be considered in planning, for example, to correct their use at runtime and thus reduce scrap. In [this project](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/vuc/lidx/1), the systematic integration of SysML2 engineering models into Digital Twins for the automated consistency assurance of these models will thus be investigated.

## Internet of Production

The vision of the Internet of Production strives for the integration of the major domains of a producing company along the lifecycle of a product (production, development, and usage). This integration, enabled by the Infrastructure of the [Internet of Production](https://www.iop.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/gpfz/), will result in a new level and understanding of cross-domain collaboration due to real-time availability of semantically adequate and contextual data from these domains.
