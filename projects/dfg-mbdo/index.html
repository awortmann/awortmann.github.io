In that context, models play key roles for either or both code/test generation and configuration/deployment of these kinds of systems, but most often feed-back from runtime to design is still done manually based on human interpretation of telemetry. Conversely, Adaptive  Systems are typically built with a MAPE-K loop featuring an implicit or explicit model of their runtime configuration (reflective layer), which can be seen as a primitive digital twin. A digital twin is a model (i.e., an abstraction of some aspect of reality in a given purpose), but its (conceptual) nature and its (technical) form are widely different from the typical software and systems engineering models considered at design time.
