DevOps is a well-established practice for software-intensive systems, and is increasingly considered for IoT. In that context, models play key roles for either or both code/test generation and configuration/deployment of these kinds of systems, but most often feed-back from runtime to design is still done manually based on human interpretation of telemetry. Conversely, Adaptive  Systems are typically built with a MAPE-K loop featuring an implicit or explicit model of their runtime configuration (reflective layer), which can be seen as a primitive digital twin. A digital twin is a model (i.e., an abstraction of some aspect of reality in a given purpose), but its (conceptual) nature and its (technical) form are widely different from the typical software and systems engineering models considered at design time. Full blown digital twins are already widely used in several domains (aerospace industry, automotive, building construction, etc.) but not that often for software intensive systems or IoT systems.
