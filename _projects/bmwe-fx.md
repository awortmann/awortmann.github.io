FACTORY-X aims to overcome the stagnation of digitalization efforts in European manufacturing by creating a secure, interoperable data infrastructure. The project enables companies across industries—automotive, aerospace, and industrial production—to share data without sacrificing sovereignty, scale beyond pilot phases, and monetize data assets. Through eleven application-focused use cases, it drives real-world business solutions and fosters innovation across entire supply networks.

Our research in this consortium focuses on interconnecting models across different silos, stakeholders, and companies such that changes across these can be analyzed and propagated.
