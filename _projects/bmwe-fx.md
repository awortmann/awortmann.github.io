FACTORY-X aims to overcome the stagnation of digitalization efforts in European manufacturing by creating a secure, interoperable data infrastructure. The project enables companies across industries—automotive, aerospace, and industrial production—to share data without sacrificing sovereignty, scale beyond pilot phases, and monetize data assets. Through eleven application-focused use cases, it drives real-world business solutions and fosters innovation across entire supply networks[^1].

Our research in this consortium focuses on interconnecting models across different silos, stakeholders, and companies such that changes across these can be analyzed and propagated.
