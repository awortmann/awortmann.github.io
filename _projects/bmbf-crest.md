With the transition from classical embedded systems to networked, collaborative embedded systems, a wide range of new applications for the German industry is emerging. The ability of a company to efficiently develop collaborative embedded systems with the highest quality will, therefore, become a decisive competitive factor. The [Collaborative Embedded Systems (CrESt)](https://crest.in.tum.de/) project aims to create a comprehensive framework for the model-driven development of collaborative embedded systems that addresses novel challenges in their engineering based on the SPES development methodology.
