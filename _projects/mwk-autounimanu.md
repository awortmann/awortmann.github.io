This research project seeks to revolutionize manufacturing by transitioning from traditional automated production to an intelligent, laser-based system. The goal is to enable rapid adoption of new materials, highly customized production (lot size one), and adaptability to market changes. The system will combine autonomous R&D labs (with AI-driven process optimization) and efficient production units, ensuring flexibility and resilience.

Key focus areas include: (1) advanced laser technologies for higher productivity and sustainability, (2) autonomous process optimization using AI and real-time data, and (3) modular, reconfigurable architectures for agile manufacturing. By leveraging machine learning and interconnected systems, the project aims to enhance quality, reduce costs, and strengthen Baden-Württemberg’s global competitiveness in high-tech manufacturing.
