The [Center for Systems Engineering](https://cse.rwth-campus.com/) aims to shape and holistically assess the required key technologies for tomorrow’s product development process. The integration of the individual development steps and tools enables a highly iterative, agile, and in part automated product development. This will facilitate model-based systems engineering in research and practice.
