The construction industry causes about 40% of global CO2 emissions. At the same time, it offers great, cost-efficient CO2 savings potential, for example through timber construction as a global carbon sink and through the further digitalization of the planning and execution of buildings. A still under-researched topic in this area is the detailed digital modeling and optimization of construction processes. Such modeling requires innovative AI methods and is essential for digital, integrative, and resource-efficient construction planning that considers as many performance criteria as possible as early as possible. The proposed PhD studies and implements this modeling and AI-based optimization using the example of a timber construction system developed by the Cluster of Excellence IntCDC. In this project, we therefore develop methods for the application, adaptation and combination of AI techniques for sustainable construction process planning in timber construction.
